There's paperwork to fill out, employees to hire, and all sorts of other drudgery, not to mention the biggest hurdle of all: providing a product or service for which customers are willing to pay. President Ulysses S. Grant foiled a gold scam. In all likelihood, it would be much easier to just stumble upon some clever scam to line your pockets. Or so it would seem. As many aspiring scam artists quickly learn, when a business scam fails, it tends to fail in rather grand fashion. Just ask any of these four teams of not-so-smooth operators. A corny sea story . Xenothemis and Hegestratos may not have been the world's first white-collar criminals, but they were certainly noteworthy for their incompetence. In 360 B.C., the pair stumbled upon what seemed like a killer plan to make some quick cash. Shipping was extremely risky at the time, and boats went down at sea with alarming frequency. To exploit this uncertainty, Xenothemis and Hegestratos devised a plan in which they would receive a cash advance to ship a load of corn from Syracuse to Athens. Due to the dangers associated with shipping, the buyer would take on full risk if the shipment didn't make it to Athens, so if the boat sank Xenothemis and Hegestratos could keep their cash. Instead of loading the ship with expensive corn, the conniving pair made a plan to sail an empty ship out to sea for a few days, then sink it and escape in lifeboats. Since the boat itself was insured, this plot seemed airtight, and the potential profit was great. Unfortunately, though, the boat's other passengers allegedly caught wind of the scheme during the attempting scuttling of the ship. These passengers were understandably a bit peeved at Hegestratos' attempts to drown them for his own financial gain. Hegestratos panicked and jumped overboard, at which point he drowned. Unable to sink the ship by himself, Xenothemis had to sail on to the port, at which point the buyer, Protos, wanted to know why his shipload of corn was empty. A legal battle followed, and although the verdict has been lost by history, it's safe to say that the late Hegestratos regretted the scam. When Friday went black . Despite his prowess as a general, Ulysses S. Grant's presidency didn't go so smoothly. Ones of its most notable scandals occurred in 1869, when a group of speculators upended the U.S gold market. The plan started when financier James Fisk and robber baron Jay Gould formed a group of speculators with the goal of cornering the gold market, which would give the group the ability to manipulate the price. Of course, one can only corner the market if there's a fixed quantity of gold available. Otherwise, the government could just sell large quantities of gold, and the cornering effort would be an expensive failure. In an effort to avoid this fate, Gould and Fisk brought President Grant's brother-in-law Abel Corbin into their fold. Using Corbin's influence to get an audience with the President, the pair would argue to Grant that selling gold was a terrible idea that the government should avoid at all costs. The wily pair also used their influence at the White House to secure a position as assistant treasurer of the United States for Daniel Butterfield, who would warn them if the government started to sell gold. With their connections in place, Fisk and Gould started buying up gold in September 1869, quickly driving the price of gold up by around 30 percent. Once Grant and his advisors got wise to the situation, though, the government quickly sold off $4 million in gold to break the corner, effectively killing the inflated prices on September 24. As investors scrambled to get rid of their overpriced gold, the price plummeted sharply, and many involved in the scam lost huge amounts of money. Fisk and Gould managed to avoid big losses due to their connections in the treasury, but what would be known as Black Friday didn't earn them a huge windfall -- and significantly harmed the American economy. Bad moves . If you've ever hired movers, you know it can be pretty pricey. Erik Deri, the founder of Woodinville, Washington-based Nationwide Moving Systems, understood that most movers were expensive, so he drummed up business by offering super-cheap quotes to frugal clients. The customers were ecstatic to find a mover who could get their belongings to a new home so cheaply. That is, until the price went up. Deri's movers would load the company's vans with all of a customer's worldly belongings, then a foreman would inform the client that they'd have to pay an inflated price to actually get their stuff to their new digs. The price hikes weren't small, either; one man's estimate stated he could move for $3,000 but was later revised to $16,000 after loading. According to authorities, if customers balked at these demands, the movers would threaten to unload their boxes and furniture into the street...and then charge them an unloading fee. If things got really sticky, Nationwide's trucks could just take off with all of the clients' possessions. Deri supposedly paid cash bonuses to employees who successfully strong-armed customers into forking over the premiums. In the end, though, Deri learned that you can't scam that many customers and hope to get away with it. In 2005 he was found guilty of 27 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion. Three of his accomplices were also convicted in connection with the moving racket. Deri was sentenced to seven years in prison, after which he'll face deportation to his native Israel. Fools for gold . Bre-X Minerals Ltd. was a small Canadian mining company that made a big announcement in 1995. Geologists had discovered gold on a site Bre-X owned near Busang, Indonesia. Not just a little gold, either -- at least 30 million ounces, possibly as much as 200 million ounces. Given the high prices of gold, such a deposit would have been worth tens of billions of dollars. Bre-X's stock price shot through the roof; shares went from being valued at a few cents to over $280 Canadian. In fact, the deposit seemed so rich and so large that a small company like Bre-X could not possibly handle it all without some help. In 1997, the Indonesian government convinced Bre-X to take on an American firm as a partner to help extract the gold. When this firm, Freeport-McMoRan, started sampling the soil at the deposit site as part of its due diligence, it reached a confusing conclusion: there wasn't any gold in the soil. Subsequent examinations by independent auditors reached the same conclusion. The \"natural\" gold that in the original samples Bre-X had taken was mostly river gold from other regions or shavings off of gold jewelry. Although the company's market cap had climbed to $4.4 billion, this report quickly destroyed Bre-X's value. Share prices dropped 97 percent in a day following the announcement, the company was soon removed from the Toronto Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and Bre-X quickly went bankrupt. Amazingly, no one ended up in jail from this scam, but you should still probably be wary if anyone offers to sell you an enormous gold mine on Borneo.

      "2. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A court Thursday rejected an appeal filed by a former administrative law judge who sued a dry cleaners for $54 million over a missing pair of pants. An unidentified man talks on a cell phone in front of the Chung family's shop, Custom Cleaners. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals \"ruled resoundingly in favor of the Chung family and denied Mr. Roy Pearson's appeal of the case completely,\" said Christopher Manning, an attorney for the Chung family, who own Custom Cleaners. \"The D.C. Court of Appeals held that the trial court correctly ruled that Mr. Pearson's claims had no merit whatsoever,\" he added. The Chungs have \"some level of relief,\" Manning told CNN, \"but they won't count Mr. Pearson out for at least trying to torment them further\" with future appeals. \"We are very happy with the result and thank everyone for supporting us,\" Jin Chung said in a statement issued by Manning. \"The past three years have been very difficult, but we hope this nightmare is finally over.\" Pearson initially sought $67 million from the Chungs, calculating the amount by estimating years of legal violations, adding nearly $2 million in common law claims for fraud. The saga began in May 2005, when Pearson took several pairs of pants to Custom Cleaners for alteration as he prepared to start his new job as an administrative law judge. He alleged that among them was a pair of pants from a blue and maroon suit. When he came to collect his clothing, he said, the Chungs tried to give him a pair of charcoal gray pants that were not his. During a two-day trial, Pearson, who represented himself, said that when he took the pants to the cleaners, his financial situation was precarious: He had just been ordered to pay $12,000 in attorney's fees to his ex-wife, and his credit cards were at their limit. He claimed millions of dollars in attorney fees and millions more in punitive damages for what he called fraudulent advertising under the law. He also claimed that a sign in the store's window promising \"satisfaction guaranteed\" was an unconditional warranty that required the defendants to honor any claim by any customer without limitation. The Chungs' attorney argued that no reasonable person would interpret the signs to mean an unconditional promise of satisfaction. District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Judith Bartnoff agreed, ruling that Custom Cleaners did not violate the city's Consumer Protection Act. Manning, whose law firm handled the appeal on a pro bono basis for the Chungs, said the Chungs hope the \"vague and often unfair\" act will be changed \"so that others do not suffer like they did.\" In August 2007, the Chungs dropped their bid to recover legal costs in the hopes that Pearson would drop his appeal. Pearson may request that the appeal be heard again by the entire panel of D.C. Court of Appeals judges, Manning said. He also could petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for an appeal. \"It is the Chungs' hope that Mr. Pearson will not attempt to appeal any further and will end his frivolous and baseless attacks on the Chung family,\" Manning wrote in the statement. \"The 3½ years this case has been pending and appealed have been very difficult for the Chungs,\" he said. \"They lost two of their dry cleaning stores and their realization of the American dream.\" He said the family wants to \"quietly return to their one remaining small dry-cleaning store ... to rebuild their lives.\" Pearson was taken off the bench in May 2007 while the lawsuit was pending and was not reappointed as an administrative law judge when his term expired. He filed a federal lawsuit in May 2008 to get his government job back, accusing city government and others of an \"unlawful demotion and subsequent termination.\" That suit remains pending. CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this story.\n",
      "3. (CNN) -- A Seattle man has been charged with insurance fraud for allegedly sinking his own yacht because of \"financial pressure and frustration with the maintenance\" of the vessel, authorities said. The Jubilee sank in Puget Sound Bay last year. On March 22, 2008, Brian Lewis, 50, scuttled the Jubilee in the Puget Sound Bay, then rowed a borrowed dinghy back to shore, according to court documents filed in February by prosecutors in King County, Washington. Later that day, Lewis boarded a flight to take him to his job in Kodiak, Alaska, as a petty officer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, according to court documents. Three days later, Lewis filed an insurance claim with USAA Insurance reporting the Jubilee sank accidentally \"due to unknown causes.\" However, due to environmental concerns, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources salvaged the vessel at a cost to the state of $2,866. An inspection found a hole was drilled into the bottom of the Jubilee, and that two main engine sea strainers appeared to have been broken with a hammer. \"The vessel appeared to have been deliberately sunk,\" authorities said in their probable cause affidavit. Confronted by investigators, Lewis admitted he intentionally sank his vessel, saying the financial strain \"caused him extreme anxiety and frustration.\" Lewis told investigators \"the engine trouble he experienced caused him to lose his temper. In his rage, he smashed the sea strainers with a hammer and drilled the hole to sink the vessel,\" the affidavit said. \"[He] wanted to clarify that his motive for sinking the vessel was anger and frustration, not greed,\" it added. Prior to its sinking, the Jubilee had been listed for sale with Mahina Yachts for $28,500. Jack Bateman, a broker with Mahina, remembers the Jubilee as a \"beautiful\" 1967 Chris Craft Cavalier. He said the Mahina has only seen this type of case one other time in its 30 years of operation. \"This is a very rare, not common occurrence\" he says. Bateman added that Mahina has yet to see any real distress sales due to the bad economy. The King County Prosecutor's Office has charged Lewis with making a fraudulent insurance claim. Lewis filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004. Messages left for him were not returned.\n",

A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. He is host of \"No Bias, No Bull\" at 8 p.m. ET on CNN while Campbell Brown is on maternity leave. Roland Martin says Michael Vick has served his sentence and should be allowed back on the field. (CNN) -- When Michael Vick completes home confinement in July, he will have served the 23-month prison sentence imposed after he pleaded guilty to federal dogfighting charges. After his release from a Kansas prison Wednesday, he headed to his home in Virginia to serve the final two months under home confinement, because all the beds at halfway houses in the area are taken. But that hasn't deterred the Vick haters who are still in an uproar over the heinous details of his dogfighting kennel. Yes, reading the details of the treatment of the dogs, including the killing of some of them, could make anyone sick. Yet what's the point of sentencing someone to jail, then having them serve their time and be released if we still want to imprison them for the rest of their lives? Frankly, I'm sick of Americans who talk all day about \"do the crime, then do the time,\" then still want to treat a man like a criminal when he gets out of prison. This doesn't just apply to Michael Vick. Look at all the individuals who are sent to prison, get out and then can't find a job. Why? Because they have the Scarlet Letter on their record, which is a big fat \"F\" for felon. Don't think I'm looking for any sympathy for someone who goes to jail. I firmly believe that you deserve all that you get for breaking the law. But listening to some of these zealots go on and on and on about Vick needing to continue to be punished is ridiculous! The judge in Vick's case has imposed a number of restrictions. One of them is that he can't ever own a dog again. OK, gotcha. But to say the man shouldn't be allowed to play in the NFL is D-U-M-B. The crimes of which he was convicted had nothing to do with playing sports. Remember Wall Street star Michael Milken? When he was sent to jail for securities fraud, he was banned from working on Wall Street again. I get that. He was an insider and allowing him back into the financial game would have been atrocious. I get it when someone is convicted of molesting children that they can't live within a certain distance of a school or be left alone around children when released. But there is nothing related to Vick's crime that says he should not be allowed to play professional football. What is particularly galling is that, right now, you have any number of football players who have beaten people -- including their wives and girlfriends -- served time for drunk driving or committed other crimes, yet they have resumed their careers. The same goes for teachers, radio and television broadcasters, politicians and others. So is this any different because it involved dogs? Are we to say that the horrible treatment of dogs is vastly different than mistreatment of human beings? The critics will likely say, \"These men are role models. Kids look up to them. They should have no business on the field.\" Yet some of these same kids are living with fathers and mothers who are felons. So are we supposed to remove them from the home as well? Enough with the public bullying. Vick was sentenced and served his time. And now he's gotten out. If you want to be angry with him, fine. But please, cut the sanctimonious crap. He deserves to make amends and get on with his life. If you were in his shoes, you would want to do the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.\n",
      "5. (CNN) -- A former federal prosecutor was arrested Wednesday on charges related to the murder of a witness in a drug case, among many other counts, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark, New Jersey, said. Former federal prosecutor Paul Bergrin is charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included a murder. Paul Bergrin and three others were taken into custody after a federal grand jury in New Jersey indicted them on 14 counts, including murder, racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering charges, a statement from Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph J. Marra Jr. said. The indictment charges Bergrin with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included the murder of a witness in a drug case and an attempt to hire a hit man in another drug case, the statement said. Bergrin also is charged with wire fraud and money laundering, Marra said. Gerald Shargel, Bergrin's attorney, said his client would plead not guilty to all charges. \"This is largely dredging up old issues, and we intend to vigorously fight the charges,\" Shargel said. The U.S. Attorney's Office statement said Bergrin was involved in the murder of a confidential witness in one federal drug case and tried to hire a Chicago, Illinois, hit man to kill a witness in another drug case. The second killing never occurred, the statement said, because the proposed hit man was a cooperating witness in the case. Marra called Bergrin's alleged conduct \"simply shocking.\" \"A licensed lawyer, a former prosecutor essentially became one of the criminals he represents, supporting, encouraging, indeed directing, a criminal enterprise that engaged in murder and murder conspiracies, drug trafficking and financial fraud,\" Marra said in the statement. \"Bergrin can now expect to feel the full weight of the very legal system he turned on its head with his conduct.\" Bergrin was an assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey before going into private practice. According to the New York Law Journal, Bergrin, 53, pleaded guilty this month to two misdemeanor counts for his involvement with a prostitution ring.  He later represented U.S. Army Sgt. Javal Davis, one of seven people charged in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq. In that case, Davis entered a plea agreement on reduced charges before his court martial began. A recorded message at Bergrin's Newark, New Jersey, office said it was closed today, and messages left with Bergrin's cell phone and the cell phones of two associates went unanswered.\n",
      "6. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors Tuesday urged a Florida judge to sentence actor Wesley Snipes to three years in prison and fine him $5 million to demonstrate to taxpayers that refusal to pay income taxes carries severe penalties. Wesley Snipes was acquitted of the most serious charges against him. Snipes is scheduled to be sentenced April 24 by U.S. District Judge William Hodges in Ocala, Florida, on three counts of failure to file federal income tax returns. One week after vowing to crack down on \"tax defiers,\" the Justice Department filed court papers seeking the maximum penalty for the three misdemeanor counts on which Snipes was convicted. \"This case presents the court with a singular opportunity to deter tax fraud nationwide,\" the government said in its sentencing recommendation. Snipes had been charged with felony conspiracy counts for participating in a scheme that rejects the legal foundation of the tax system. However, a jury accepted his argument that he was innocently duped by errant tax advisers, and acquitted him on the most serious charges. \"The fact that Snipes was acquitted on two felony charges and convicted 'only' on three misdemeanor counts has been portrayed in the mainstream media as a 'victory' for Snipes,\" the government document says. \"The troubling implication of such coverage for the millions of average citizens who are aware of this case is that the rich and famous Wesley Snipes has 'gotten away with it.' In the end the criminal conduct of Snipes must not be seen in such a light.\" Assistant Attorney General Nathan Hochman, head of the Justice Department's Tax Division, last week promised to beef up the government's efforts to pursue those engaged in a variety of schemes making legal assertions that income taxes are either voluntary or unconstitutional. \"For nearly a decade Snipes has engaged in a campaign of criminal tax conduct combining brazen defiance with insidious concealment,\" the prosecutors say. \"By these means Snipes has escaped paying more than $15 million in income tax to the IRS and has pursued an intended fraudulent harm to the United States Treasury of more than $41 million.\" The document says Snipes shipped millions of dollars to accounts in Switzerland, Antigua and the Isle of Man to avoid taxes. \"Given defendant's income, earning capacity, and financial resources, both disclosed and undisclosed, the United States submits that a fine of at least $5 million is warranted,\" the sentencing recommendation says. The 35-page argument for the stiffest possible penalty ends with a dramatic flair. \"In the defendant Wesley Snipes, the court is presented with a wealthy, famous and inveterate tax scofflaw. If ever a tax offender was deserving of being held accountable to the maximum extent for his criminal wrongdoing, Snipes is that defendant,\" it says. The IRS is also seeking repayment of all taxes and interest through civil court proceedings. E-mail to a friend .\n",
      "7. Editor's Note: In an exclusive series this week on \"Campbell Brown,\" the FBI has unveiled three additions to its list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. The FBI says Semion Mogilevich has been involved in arms trafficking, prostitution, extortion and murder for hire. NEWTOWN, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Semion Mogilevich may be the most powerful man you've never heard of. The FBI says Mogilevich, a Russian mobster, has been involved in arms trafficking, prostitution, extortion and murder for hire. \"He has access to so much, including funding, including other criminal organizations, that he can, with a telephone call and order, affect the global economy,\" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Peter Kowenhoven. Mogilevich's alleged brutality, financial savvy and international influence have earned him a slot on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, though he has lived and operated from Moscow, Russia, for years.  Watch CNN report on Mogilevich » . \"He's a big man. He's a very powerful man,\" FBI Special Agent Mike Dixon said. \"I think more powerful than a John Gotti would be, because he has the ability to influence nations. Gotti never reached that stature.\" He is accused of swindling Canadian and U.S. investors out of $150 million in a complex international financial scheme. It centered on a firm called YBM, which purportedly made magnets at a factory in Hungary. Authorities say the scheme involved preparing bogus financial books and records, lying to Securities and Exchange Commission officials, offering bribes to accountants and inflating stock values of YBM, which was headquartered in Newtown, Pennsylvania. In a raid in 1998, FBI agents found a treasure trove of documents -- purchase orders, invoices, shipping orders, even technical drawings -- everything a legitimate business would produce. But there was one thing missing. \"There were no magnets,\" Dixon said. It was all a sham, investigators say. \"In essence, what his companies were doing was moving money through bank accounts in Budapest and countries throughout the world and reporting these to the investment community as purchases of raw materials and sales of magnets,\" Dixon said. And because the company was publicly traded, anyone owning the stock would have made a lot of money. \"And of course Mogilevich controlled large, large blocks of stock from the outset, and he made a substantial amount of money in this process,\" Dixon said. Investors lost millions into the pockets of Mogilevich and his associates. He and his associates were indicted in 2003 on 45 counts of racketeering, securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering. Russian authorities arrested him last year on tax fraud charges, but because the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, he remained beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. He is now free on bail. The FBI believes Mogilevich moved on after YBM and began manipulating international energy markets, giving him a large influence on other nations. Dixon noted that Mogilevich had control or influence over companies involved in natural gas disputes between Russia and Ukraine. Authorities say Mogilevich, who has an economics degree from Ukraine, is known for his ruthless nature but also for his business acumen, which led to his nickname \"the Brainy Don.\" \"He has a very sophisticated, well-educated, loyal group of associates that he works with,\" Dixon said. \"He hires top-notch consultants, attorneys, risk management firms to assist him and protect him in his criminal ventures.\" Louise Shelley, an organized crime expert from George Mason University, says Mogilevich is a new kind of criminal. \"The major criminal organizations in Russia have not only tapped into people with economics degrees,\" Shelley said. \"They've tapped into people with PHDs in finance and statistics who assist them.\" The FBI hopes Mogilevich will eventually travel to a country that has an extradition treaty with the U.S. But, in case he doesn't, his wanted poster will be distributed all over Russia.\n",
      "8. Washington (CNN) -- Jennifer Tonge is not a lunatic. She is a member of the British House of Lords, appointed to that eminent body in 2005 after a career in politics and medicine. On February 11, she was asked a question by www.thejc.com, the online version of Britain's Jewish Chronicle. Tonge serves as patron of an online journal based in Gaza, the Palestine Telegraph. The previous week, the Palestine Telegraph accused the Israeli medical teams doing humanitarian work in Haiti of harvesting organs from earthquake victims. TheJC.com asked Tonge for comment. Tonge first commended the Israeli teams for their work in Haiti. She then added these words: . \"To prevent allegations such as these -- which have already been posted on YouTube -- going any further, the IDF and the Israeli Medical Association should establish an independent inquiry immediately to clear the names of the team in Haiti.\" The YouTube video to which Tonge refers can be seen here. It's the work of a solo crank, and hardly seems to require an \"independent inquiry\" to refute. The statement to TheJC.com was not Lady Tonge's first entry into Middle East analysis. She has expressed herself often on the subject of Israel and Israel's supporters, and in vivid terms. In a speech to a meeting during her Liberal Democratic Party's annual conference in 2006, Tonge declared: \"The pro-Israeli lobby has got its grips on the Western world, its financial grips. I think they've probably got a grip on our party.\" (That grip was not too tight to prevent Tonge's party from collectively denouncing Israel for attacking Hezbollah after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers.) On February 14, Lady Tonge was removed from her position as health critic for the Liberal Democratic Party in the House of Lords. But Tonge's comments did not originate in the ether. They could be footnoted to a respectable newspaper in Sweden. In the summer of 2009, the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet published a story about a recent mass indictment in New Jersey. On July 23, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey announced the arrest of 44 people for a range of criminal enterprises involving bank fraud, rigging of bids on public projects, trafficking in counterfeit goods, etc. The accused represented the gorgeous mosaic of New Jersey politics, with last names like \"Suarez,\" \"Catrillo,\" \"Cardwell,\" and \"Khalil.\" Some of the names were Jewish. One of the Jewish names, Levy Izhak Rosenbaum, was accused of the lurid crime of trafficking in the purchase and sale of human organs. Rosenbaum was said to have offered sums of $10,000 to entice poor people in Israel and Eastern Europe to sell kidneys to him, which he would then remarket for $160,000 to transplant patients in the United States. Aftonbladet transformed this story of illegal commerce into a story of Jewish predation. The paper gave space to a freelance writer -- Donald Bostrom -- to charge that the Israeli army regularly harvested organs from the bodies of slain Palestinians. After briefly acknowledging that the vast majority of the world's illegally harvested organs come from China, Pakistan, and the Philippines, Bostrom then hurled this astounding charge: . \"Palestinians also harbor strong suspicions that young men have been seized, and made to serve as organ reserve, just as in China and Pakistan, before being killed.\" Jewish vampirism is an ancient fantasy, dating back to the Middle Ages. Yet it remains current in the contemporary Middle East. A Syrian film company created a multipart TV drama out of the story in 2003. The drama was broadcast worldwide on Hezbollah's al-Manar satellite network. Iranian state TV broadcast a drama in 2004 in which the plot turns on an Israeli plan to steal Palestinian children's eyes. It's a winding road from medieval folktales to Hezbollah TV to the New Jersey mob to a Swedish daily to the British House of Lords. But it's a road traveled by more and more people. On February 11, Tel Aviv's Reut Institute presented a paper to the Israeli cabinet warning of \"delegitimization\" aimed at the Jewish state. As reported by Ha'aretz, the paper warns: . \"The 'delegitimizers' cooperate with organizations engaging in legitimate criticism of Israel's policy in the territories such as Amnesty [International] and Human Rights Watch, blurring the line between legitimate censure and delegitimization. ... The network's activists are not mostly Palestinian, Arab or Muslim. Many of them are European and North American left-wing activists,\" who portray Israel as a pariah state and deny its right to exist. In the United States, where pro-Israel feeling runs stronger and the activist left is weaker, the delegitimization project focuses less on Israel itself, and more on Israel's supporters. The central text for this project is a book called \"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\" co-authored by Profs. Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer, which argues that \"the Israel lobby\" maneuvered the United States into the Iraq war on Israel's behalf. Walt and Mearsheimer present their argument in delicate language, but it's the same case argued by Prof. Juan Cole of the University of Michigan, again not a crank, but a past president of the Middle East Studies Association. In a 2004 blog post, Cole wrote of a \"one-two punch secretly planned by the pro-Likud faction in the Department of Defense. First, Iraq would be taken out by the United States, and then Iran. David Wurmser, a key member of the group, also wanted Syria included. These pro-Likud intellectuals concluded that 9/11 would give them carte blanche to use the Pentagon as Israel's Gurkha regiment, fighting elective wars on behalf of Tel Aviv (not wars that really needed to be fought, but wars that the Likud coalition thought it would be nice to see fought so as to increase Israel's ability to annex land and act aggressively, especially if someone else's boys did the dying).\" Hard to miss here the echo of another ancient myth, memorably enunciated by a character in John Buchan's 1915 spy novel, \"The Thirty-Nine Steps.\" \"[If] you're on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to the real boss, 10 to one you are brought up against a little white-faced Jew in a bath-chair with an eye like a rattlesnake. Yes, Sir, he is the man who is ruling the world just now.\" Walt returned to his theme in a blog post this week in Foreign Policy: . \"Israeli leaders from across the political spectrum became cheerleaders for the invasion, and they played a prominent role in helping to sell the war here in the United States.\" This debate came home to the blogosphere last week, when New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier published a long article denouncing uber-blogger Andrew Sullivan as either an anti-Jewish bigot or else \"moronically insensitive.\" Sullivan -- a former editor of the magazine for which his once-intimate friend Wieseltier writes -- has over the past few months abruptly switched from passionate champion of Israel to strident criticism of Israel and its supporters. Many rallied to Sullivan's defense on the specific complaint at issue, myself included. But one wishes that people who do not share the malignant feelings of a Tonge would take care not to use the same malignant language. It's possible to hate Israel without hating Jews. It's even possible to hate Jews without hating Israel, as is said of a famously nasty British media personality: \"He managed the impressive feat of being intensely anti-Semitic without becoming even slightly pro-Arab.\" But these interesting theoretical potentialities exist mainly on the blackboard. In real life, it becomes very difficult to separate hatred of the Jewish state from hatred of the Jews who live in that state. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.\n",
      "9. TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- He's been labeled by many as the \"reformist,\" a man who can take Iran beyond the truculent anti-Western rhetoric of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Moussavi was not seen as a reformer during his stint as prime minister during the 1980s. So, when Iran's government announced over the weekend that Mir Hossein Moussavi had lost in his bid to become the country's next president, young Iranians took to the streets by the thousands alleging ballot fraud. Thousands of others around the globe championed the cause on social-networking Web sites and agreed to wear green on Monday in solidarity with Moussavi's supporters. But what is often lost in the outrage is whether Iran would look different under a Moussavi presidency.  Watch more about the vote » . Though the 67-year old is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during a bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s, he also was a hard-liner whom the Economist described as a \"firm radical.\" He, like most Iranians in power, does not believe in the existence of Israel. He defended the taking of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979, which led to the break in ties between the countries. He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents and backed the fatwa against British author Salman Rushdie. And as late as April, he opposed suspending the country's nuclear-enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use. \"I wouldn't go as far as (call it) a 'Velvet Revolution,'\" Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said of the phrase many are using to describe the rallies in Iran. \"At the end of the day, Moussavi has been more involved and been there from the very beginning of the revolution in a way that Ahmadinejad never was,\" Parsi told \"CNN Newsroom\" on Sunday. \"Moussavi was one of the founders of the revolution.\" Moussavi was named prime minister in 1980. A year earlier, Iran had become an Islamic republic after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The same year, a group of students in support of the Islamic revolution took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days. In an interview with The New York Times in 1981, Moussavi defended the hostage-taking as the beginning of \"second stage of our revolution.\" \"It was after this that we rediscovered our true Islamic identity,\" he said. The incident, Moussavi added, ended the \"problem of pro-American circles and their following in Iran. \"After this, we felt the sense that we could look Western policy in the eye and analyze it the way they had been evaluating us for many years.\" In 1988, author Salman Rushdie released his fourth novel, 'The Satanic Verses,' which Iran said insulted Islam. The country's supreme leader called for the death of Rushdie. And Moussavi, in a radio broadcast, said the order would be carried out. Moussavi told the Financial Times in April that he would not halt Iran's uranium enrichment program if he were president. \"No one in Iran would accept suspension,\" he said. Since his stint as prime minister, Moussavi has been absent from politics. For the past 10 years, his official job has been to head the state-owned Art Center. He is a painter. The long \"20 years of silence,\" as the Iranian media dubbed it, is working to Moussavi's advantage. Of Iran's population of 70 million, almost 60 percent are younger than 28 -- too young to have lived through the 1979 revolution. To them, Moussavi represents a sea change from Ahmadinejad. While the president calls the Holocaust a myth, Moussavi has condemned the killing of Jews. While Ahmadinejad has unleashed the morality police to ensure that women cover their hair in public, Moussavi has pledged his support for women's rights. Most importantly, the youth are unhappy about the faltering economy under Ahmadinejad, with the unemployment rate topping 30 percent by some accounts. They are hungry for anyone who represents change, analysts have said. \"We have really an interesting moment of historic irony here,\" Afshin Molavi, a fellow at the New America Foundation, said on the CNN talk show Fareed Zakaria GPS. \"Moussavi is a child of the revolution. Moussavi was never a real reformer, either, when he was prime minister. \"And now he's being faced with the question: Should he unleash the young people out onto the streets who supported him -- thus threatening the very system that he fought for?\" Shahriar Etimani, an Iranian-American who was part of a demonstration Sunday in Washington, D.C., to protest the election results, said he realizes Moussavi is part of the establishment, but he remains hopeful. \"The cynical part of me says that these guys have 30 years' of experience of survival. So this will be another blip on the radar?\" he said. \"The hopeful part of me says that, 'You know what? There needs to be a catalyst and we don't know where that catalyst comes from. We don't know where that tipping point will come from.'\" CNN's Saeed Ahmed in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n",
      "10. Washington (CNN) -- A filing on behalf of basketball superstar LeBron James dismisses as \"rank speculation\" claims by a Washington lawyer that he is the athlete's biological father, saying the man has \"delusions\" about alleged family ties. Lawyers for James and his mother filed papers in federal court Monday seeking to dismiss a pending lawsuit. Leicester Stovell alleges the NBA all-star and his family have been involved in a cover-up to deny paternity, by committing fraud and misrepresentation. The 14-page document said Stovell had completely failed to prove any of the facts alleged in his June 23 complaint. And they said he was motivated only by fame and money, calling Stovell's actions a \"fanciful hope for celebrity.\" The lawsuit claims Stovell met James' mother, Gloria, in a Washington bar and restaurant in 1984, when she was visiting from Ohio. She was 15 or 16 at the time, and Stovell says they had sex only once, and was informed by Gloria James months later that she was pregnant. He claims she told him the child would be named LeBron, similar to Leicester Bryce, Stovell's first and middle names. Stovell is asking for unspecified millions of dollars in damages, and says he has been trying for three years to establish paternity, which he hopes would lead to financial and commercial opportunities. He is a solo legal practitioner in the District of Columbia, and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf. He alleges a DNA test that showed he was not James' father was falsified. James' attorneys, Frederick Nance and John Burlingame, dismissed those suggestions in often mocking tones aimed at the plaintiff. \"Stovell's claims for millions of dollars from his putative son and Gloria James are based upon rank speculation,\" said the court filing, \"that a man who claims that as a 29-year-old lawyer he got a 15-year-old girl pregnant during a one-night stand and who never contributed a penny in child support would earn millions in commercial endorsements by crawling out of the woodwork after the child he never gave a thought to became an NBA star.\" James, a native of Akron, Ohio, recently left the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat for what is believed to be one of the richest sports contracts in history. He is the reigning most valuable player of the NBA, and has carefully cultivated a public image as one of the most popular and talented athletes. The complaint filed June 23 by Stovell said, \"I recently have concluded that a comprehensive, sophisticated and well-funded effort might well have been under way for quite some time, perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant LeBron James was in high school, to frustrate identification of his real father, and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me.\" James' lawyers think otherwise. \"Stovell may truly believe that he is the father of LeBron James, even though a DNA test has told him otherwise. But his delusions do not give rise to a cause of action against either Gloria or LeBron James.\" Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency, alleging racial discrimination. Federal court records show the case was settled when the SEC paid him $230,000, while not admitting fault.\n",
      "11. New York (CNN) -- A Malaysian man was charged on Thursday for hacking into the computer  network of a U.S. Federal Reserve bank and for stealing more than 400,000 stolen  credit card and debit card numbers, according to federal authorities. Lin Mun Poo, 32, is suspected of accessing financial records at a Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland, Ohio, by \"exploiting a vulnerability he found within their secure system,\" according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of New York. At least 10 Federal Reserve Bank computers were affected by the breach, resulting in thousands of dollars in damage, the statement said. Poo was arrested on October 21, hours after his arrival in the United States, when Secret Service agents  observed him selling stolen credit card numbers for $1,000 at a Brooklyn diner, the statement said. Authorities discovered a \"massive quantity\" of stolen personal financial data following a forensic examination of Poo's \"heavily encrypted\" laptop computer, the U.S. attorney's office statement said. Poo had obtained the numbers by hacking into numerous systems, including  FedComp, a data processor for federal credit unions, the statement said. \"As today's technology continues to evolve, cybercriminals use these advances and enhancements to perpetrate an expanding range of crimes,\" Secret Service Special Agent Brian Parr said in the statement. The four counts against Poo include access device fraud and aggravated identity theft. If convicted, he could a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Poo's attorney, Kannan Sundaram, could not immediately be reached for comment.\n",
      "12. Parker, Colorado (CNN) -- When the sniper's bullet hit his neck, Staff Sgt. Matthew Keil nearly blacked out. \"I had heard the gunshot, and it felt like someone had kicked me right in the back. A ton of bricks swung and hit me in the back, and I fell,\" he said. \"I couldn't feel my body. I could only feel my head, and it felt like I was floating.\" He was on a rooftop in Ramadi, Iraq, leading a nine-man squad. His men rushed to his aid, stopped the bleeding and then strapped him to a stretcher to evacuate him. This is when Keil finally closed his eyes. A short time later, a world away, in Colorado, Tracy Keil's phone rang: Her husband had been severely wounded. Tracy Keil was a successful accountant working in corporate America. She didn't know it at the time, but that day, February 24, 2007, was the last day she would ever work a regular job. A much more difficult job and an uncertain future awaited her. Sgt. Keil opened his eyes again three days later at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Tracy was by his side. \"My wife was standing next to the bed, and she said, 'I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. I'll be here as long as you need. You're stuck with me,' \" he recalls. Matthew's legs and right arm were paralyzed, and he had minimal control over his left arm. He would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. This is the point where some spouses call it quits. \"I could have. I watched a lot of wives leave. When we said our vows, I meant every word of it. It didn't matter what physical or mental condition he was in. It just didn't. He was alive, and that's all that mattered,\" Tracy says. Down, but not out, they set about building a new life: Months of physical therapy and rehab, then back to Colorado. It was a lot for any couple to handle, but Tracy, 33, and Matt, 29, were still newlyweds. They had exchanged vows just six weeks to the day before Matt was shot. While most young couples are focused on building careers and starting a family, the Keils were focused on learning to live in their new roles: him as paraplegic, her as caregiver. They were determined to not let the injury define them. They would have a full and productive life, but it would take determination and hard work. \"I think Matt and I were more prepared as a couple for death than for an injury like this,\" Tracy says. \"We had talked about a lot of things, but we have never talked about this.\" So they turned to the Department of Veterans Affairs for help. The Keils say the VA has taken good care of Matthew's primary medical concerns, but there was no help for Tracy. She longed for support and to be recognized for her role as Matthew's caregiver. In the Army, Matthew loved the feeling of being part of a team. But the Keils felt abandoned. Then, in May 2010, a new federal law passed that promised to help caretakers like Tracy. Under the law, caregivers would receive a financial stipend, health care, training and -- perhaps most importantly -- respite care.  Trained health care providers would come into the home and give the caretaker a break. Obama signs $3.6 billion veterans caregiver bill . The law was supposed to take effect on January 31, but so far, none of the new benefits have been implemented. The VA says it is unable to provide a timeline for when the benefits will be available, but in a statement, the agency says it's working as quickly as possible. \"VA understands that every day is a challenge for the Caregivers of our most critically injured or ill Veterans. That's why VA is working to move forward with deliberate haste to implement this complex Act. Different benefits will have different implementation timelines based upon the law's requirements and the complexity of the benefit.\" During the signing ceremony in May, President Obama hailed the legislation as \"a major step forward in America's commitment to families and caregivers who tend to our wounded warriors every day.\" When asked about the delay in implementation, a White House official said \"the President views delays in payments to caregivers as unacceptable. He has directed his team to work through options immediately to get these benefits to the caregivers who need them.\" The VA says that the new program is complicated to implement and that it has never before given benefits to nonveterans, so systems must be out into place to determine eligibility and prevent fraud and abuse. The delay has left the Keils felling abandoned once again. Tracy has been forced to give up her career and faces decades of caring for Matt. As much as the benefits, Tracy is looking for recognition for the work she does to help her wounded warrior husband. \"I had a great job, I made good money, we had plans to buy a house and move forward. I had a lot of potential.\" She says. \"Now it's like I'm working for the VA for free.\" Matt is unable to even get himself out of bed and needs constant care with everything from feeding to using the toilet. For Tracy, it's a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job. \"There are days that I think, 'How am I going to do this for the rest of my life?' \" She says, \"I love him, and I would do anything for him, and that's what gets you though those really, really hard days.\" Through their hard work, the Keils have built a new life. A nonprofit group, Homes for Our Troops, built a wheelchair-accessible house for the Keils, and through artificial insemination, the couple's hope of starting a family has come true: Twins Faith and Matthew Jr. were born in November. The babies add even more work for Tracy. Given Matt's injury, some people have told them they have no business having kids. \"I feel like we should be afforded all the same hopes and dreams that everybody else has,\" she says. \"I don't think because he is injured, we should have any less dreams than anyone else.\" After four years of dealing with the VA, Tracy Keil says she has developed a reputation as a fighter. It's a part of her role as caretaker that she takes very seriously, but she looks forward to a day when she won't have to waste her valuable energy fighting for their benefits. \"Despite what the VA must think, I don't enjoy fighting with them for every little thing. It would be nice to just be able to just ask for something and them say 'Sure, it's in the regulations, here you go.' That would be wonderful.\" She says. \"But the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and I squeak a lot.\"\n",
      "13. Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lenny Dykstra, a three-time major league All-Star outfielder who played for the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies, was charged Monday with multiple counts of allegedly leasing cars using phony businesses and credit information, and with drug possession, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office announced. At a court hearing Monday, Dykstra was taken into custody and jailed, with bail set at $500,000. According to the complaint, Dykstra, 48, and two co-defendants -- Robert Hymers, 27, his accountant and friend; and Christopher Gavanis, 30, a friend -- are accused of trying to lease various luxury vehicles from several dealerships by providing fraudulent information and claiming credit through a phony business called Home Free Systems. None of the defendants could be reached for comment Monday, and it could not be determined whether they had retained attorneys. Dykstra's attorney in a pending federal case told CNN he no longer represents Dykstra, and representatives at the public defenders' office told CNN none of the three defendants had retailed public defenders. At two dealerships, Dykstra and Hymers allegedly provided information from a man they claimed was a co-signer but who had not authorized his name to be used, the complaint alleges. Leases were not approved at two dealerships and all three men allegedly drove off with three cars at one company without lease approval, said Deputy District Attorney Alex Karkanen, with the office's Auto Insurance Fraud Division. When Dykstra was first arrested in April, Los Angeles police detectives investigating the case executed a search warrant at his Encino home and allegedly found cocaine and Ecstasy along with Somatropin, a synthetic human growth hormone. Dykstra was charged Monday with five counts of attempted grand theft auto, eight counts of filing false financial statements, four counts of identity theft, three counts of grand theft auto and three counts of possession of a controlled substance. All are felonies. In addition, he is charged with one misdemeanor count each of possession of a controlled substance without a prescription and unauthorized possession of a syringe. If convicted, Dykstra could face up to 12 years in state prison. In a separate case, Dykstra was indicted in May on federal bankruptcy fraud charges including obstruction of justice, for allegedly taking  more than $400,000 in property that should have gone to his creditors, then lying about it under oath, prosecutors claim. In the federal indictment, Dykstra is accused of stealing, hiding and destroying items such as chandeliers, artwork, and sports memorabilia from his repossessed $18 million Ventura County mansion. His attorney, Mark Worksman has characterized the federal case as \"a scorched-earth bankruptcy proceeding\" and blamed the auto-related accusations as a \"vendetta\" by former caretakers. Dykstra had remained free on $150,000 bond in the federal case.\n",
      "14. (CNN) -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott met late Thursday with a group of several hundred Florida A&M students upset over his recommendation that trustees suspend the school's president in the wake of alleged hazing and \"financial irregularities.\" Chanting \"We've got questions. You've got answers,\" the students marched to the governor's mansion, promising to stay until Scott changed his mind. \"We are not going to leave,\" said Breyon Love, the FAMU student body president. \"Mr. Governor, with all due respect, we will be here all night, all day tomorrow until you apologize or rescind that recommendation.\" Appearing in a gray sweatshirt, Scott addressed the crowd through a megaphone outside the mansion, thanking them for caring and coming out. \"I want the best thing for FAMU. I want the best thing for the FAMU family. I want the best thing for the great state of Florida,\" the governor told students, although not conceding to their wishes. Earlier, Scott had told the chairman of FAMU's board of trustees, Solomon L. Badger III, that he felt the board should take further action against university President James Ammons when it meets Monday, the statement said. The governor also \"placed a call\" to Ammons to notify him of these conversations. \"I think it's in his best interests (to) make sure that there is no question that this university is doing the right thing and cooperating,\" Scott said Thursday. The discussions came after Scott returned Thursday from a trade mission to Israel and was briefed by staffers on recent developments out of the Tallahassee university, according to the governor's office. Ammons responded Thursday that he was \"sure that this investigation will determine that, under my leadership, the administration acted appropriately.\" At the same time, he said he was prepared to accept his fate. \"I serve at the pleasure of the FAMU board of trustees, and I will abide by whatever decision the board reaches,\" he said. Badger also released a statement in which he acknowledged \"a communication with the governor.\" He said he hadn't talked with other trustees, promising that \"we will make a decision about how we move forward Monday.\" \"This is a very difficult decision that we are facing,\" Badger said. The band's director, Julian White, has been placed on administrative leave. One trustee, Rufus Montgomery, advocated a week ago that the university president should likewise be suspended -- but, instead, the board voted then to reprimand him. \"If you can place ... Julian White on administrative leave pending an investigation outcome, then we as a board can place James Ammons on administrative leave, procedure-wise,\" Montgomery said December 8. The school president had pledged Wednesday to \"root out this culture of hazing,\" though he declined to offer details about what specifically might change. Band drum major Robert Champion Jr., 26, died after a November 19 football game following a suspected hazing incident. He \"reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe,\" authorities said in a statement. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No cause of death has been released. Some band members said he may have died after a rite of passage called \"crossing Bus C.\" One member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that members \"walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus back backward while the bus is full of other band members, and you get beaten until you get to the back.\" About three weeks before Champion's death, freshman band member Bria Hunter suffered a cracked femur, deep bone bruising and blood clots after being beaten repeatedly on the thighs, according to arrest affidavits from Tallahassee police. Three men -- Sean Hobson, 23, Aaron Golson, 19, and James Harris, 22 -- were charged with hazing, a crime under Florida law, this week in her case. Hobson and Golson additionally are charged with felony battery. \"We're sending all these kids off to school. ... We expect them to come back with an education and alive,\" Scott said Thursday. The university's troubles go beyond the hazing reports. Jerry Bailey, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said Wednesday that authorities looking into Champion's death had found evidence of \"financial irregularities having to do with the band and several other components of the university.\" The suspected fraud is not directly related to Champion's death, Bailey said. \"It became apparent (from) some of the people that we interviewed (that) the financial irregularities had to do with the band travels and other sports and administrative components of the university,\" he said. The state commissioner said it is premature to conclude that the irregularities are \"systemic,\" adding that it is too soon to tell how much money may be involved. But, he added, \"it's not just isolated\" to the band program. In a statement Wednesday, Badger -- chairman of FAMU's trustees -- said the university could not comment, \"but we are cooperating fully with this and all investigations.\" The governor said Thursday that he isn't advocating that Ammons resign but rather \"step aside\" until the investigation is complete. Ideally, this inquiry will show that whatever problems are \"isolated,\" he added. \"My goal is to have a thorough investigation that everybody feels very comfortable that everybody cooperated with,\" Scott said. \"Hopefully, there was nothing more (Ammons) could do.\" Champions' parents did not reference Ammons specifically during an interview, which was conducted with HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky before Scott made his recommendation. Yet the young man's father did state that it was important that there's accountability -- for both Champion's death and hazing in general. \"I think the school should be held accountable, I think that each organization should be held accountable,\" Robert Champion Sr. said Thursday. \"We have to get down to the root of the problem, so that everyone can be responsible.\" His wife, Pam Champion, said their family will champion anti-hazing education efforts and look into setting up a hotline through which people can anonymously call in reports of hazing. She said that everyone at FAMU -- from administrators, to students, to alumni -- and other schools need to work together to stop hazing, which she called endemic to a larger cultural issue. \"If you're not going to be part of the solution, then you are part of the problem,\" Pam Champion said. \"The idea is to (get) rid of the whole culture, the whole mind-set of it.\" CNN's Jason Carroll, John Branch, Rich Phillips and Adam Reiss contributed to this report.\n",
      "15. (CNN) -- The careers of Russian oligarchs who have sought to wield power against the Kremlin in the media or politics have not tended to go far. Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, an oil magnate who backed an opposition party, has been in jail since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 on charges of tax evasion and fraud. Vladimir A. Gusinsky and Boris A. Berezovsky, both of whom owned media outlets that were critical of the government, fled the country. During the 1990s, it was common for oligarchs to oppose the Kremlin, said Henry Hale, director of the Institute for Europe, Russian and Eurasian Studies at George Washington University. But once Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, \"He started making examples of high-profile business people/oligarchs,\" Hale said. Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, was building an organization that could have served as a platform from which to challenge Putin in 2004, Hale said. \"His real sin was mobilizing a campaign that seemed aimed at the presidency,\" he added. Khodorkovsky's jailing in 2004 \"served as an example for most of the others,\" Hale said. \"You didn't see many other big business people openly challenging the government since that time.\" Instead, wealthy Russians have been careful not to draw the Kremlin's ire, he said. \"They either laid low or supported the Kremlin's leadership actively.\" Now, it's Mikhail Prokhorov, the owner of the New Jersey Nets whose $18 billion puts him among the world's richest people and who announced Monday he is running to replace Putin. Profile: Who is Mikhail Prokhorov? Though Prokhorov is unlikely to topple the incumbent, his fate could prove more benign than that of many of his fellow oligarchs, said Stephen Cohen, professor of Russian studies and history at New York University. \"He would not do it without the support of Putin or the men around Putin,\" said Cohen in a telephone interview. \"He's not an independent actor ... his wealth is still dependent on Kremlin approval.\" Prokhorov, like all the oligarchs who remain in Russia with their wealth intact, has made political and probably financial accommodations with the Kremlin, said Cohen, author of \"Soviet Fate and Lost Alternatives.\" Among Prokhorov's assets are vast mineral holdings that remain underground. \"He'd like to sell them outright, or at least a controlling share of them, to Western countries so he can cash in while his political standing is OK,\" Cohen said. But companies in the West will not deal with him or any other oligarch unless a commission established in Russia for such investment approves it, he said. \"And the chairman of the commission is Putin.\" That means Prokhorov is unlikely to do anything to offend Putin, Cohen said. So, why is he running against him? As things now stand, Putin will be running against Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the longtime leader of the Communist Party, which represents the only real electoral opposition in the country, according to Cohen. Though not well-funded, the party is well-organized and efficient and could make Zyuganov a more formidable opponent at the polls by the March election, Cohen said. That scenario is even more likely if Zyuganov benefits from protest votes by the thousands of Russians who have taken to the streets in recent days, Cohen said. If the demonstrators and their sympathizers are members of the affluent middle class, as some observers have suggested, \"Then it would make sense to give them somebody other than the Communists to vote for -- if you're looking to divide the anti-Putin vote,\" he said. \"They'll vote for the so-called successful businessman.\" Demonstrations challenge Putin's hold on power . Prokhorov's candidacy would likely draw the anti-Putin vote away from the Communists and divide the opposition, Cohen said. \"They think they know what they're doing, and I guess they do,\" he added. But Hale was not persuaded that Prokhorov's candidacy is fake. \"Conspiracy theories sometimes, actually, are just conspiracy theories,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"In this particular case, it seems to be real.\" Citing the civil unrest shaking Russia, he said, \"people like him are sensing now's the time to criticize the Kremlin. Still, Hale acknowledged, Prokhorov appears to have hedged his bets. \"He has criticized people around Putin, but not Putin himself.\" But even if pseudo-candidates wind up in the election, that's not necessarily a bad omen for democracy, Cohen said. More choice \"is the foundation of a democratic system,\" he added. One reason that suggests Prokhorov may be sincere in his putative effort to unseat Putin is the fact that his sister runs quasi-academic journals financed by her brother that are frequently critical of the Kremlin, said Harley Balzer, a professor of government at Georgetown University. But he, too, said it was not clear. \"It's an important story; I wish we knew what the hell was going on,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n",
      "16. (CNN) -- The acquittal and mistrial in John Edwards' campaign finance fraud trial completes a fall from grace that transformed the man who might have been president into one of the most vilified and lampooned political figures in the country. Opinion: Edwards jury got it exactly right . The boyish-looking, smooth-talking lawyer and self-described \"son of a millworker\" was once known for rallying supporters with a populist mantra describing two Americas -- the haves and have-nots. Now he is best known for fathering a child in an extramarital affair while his wife Elizabeth battled incurable cancer and, according to prosecutors, scheming to use wealthy donors' money to help him cover up his affair and hide his mistress from the public. WTVD: Juror had no intention of flirting with Edwards . It was all so different five years ago, when Edwards could be heard preaching his populist prose to Iowa voters who eagerly packed into lumber barns, Veterans of Foreign Wars halls and restaurants across the state. He had every reason to believe he could be president. He felt the country would let Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, both senators at the time with presidential ambitions of their own, destroy each other with negative campaigning. John Edwards: Once a cheater, always a cheater? And if the country wasn't ready to elect a black man or a woman president, he would rise as the more experienced and safe nominee. To many voters, Edwards was a fitting candidate to live in the White House and serve as president. Instead, Edwards appeared in front of TV cameras Thursday and took responsibility for \"my sins\" after his federal corruption case ended in an acquittal and mistrial. Prosecutors had accused Edwards of using almost $1 million in illegal campaign contributions to keep his pregnant mistress under wraps. But after more than 50 hours of deliberations, jurors cleared him of one of six counts and deadlocked on the rest. Why politicians lie . Edwards, who turns 59 on June 10, argued that while his actions were wrong, they were not illegal. Emerging from the courthouse with his parents and daughter at his side, he said that while he never believed he committed a crime, \"I did an awful, awful lot that was wrong, and there is no one else responsible for my sins.\" Now a widower, he is the sole caregiver to his two youngest children by his late wife -- Emma Claire, 13, and Jack, 11. The couple also raised two older children. Their son, Wade, died at age 16 in a 1996 road accident. Daughter Cate Edwards Upham attended every day of her father's four-week trial, sitting behind Edwards and next to her grandparents. Edwards charges: The rundown . Edwards also provides financial support for his daughter with Rielle Hunter, his mistress from the campaign trail during his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 election. A product of a working class family from South Carolina, Edwards got a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1977. He became a successful trial lawyer representing claimants against large corporations and insurance companies. He won his first, and only major, political race in 1998, unseating a Republican incumbent to become a U.S. senator from North Carolina. As a senator, Edwards reportedly made it onto a list of potential running mates for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. He didn't make the ticket that time. But before his first term ended, he was running for president and ended up as Sen. John Kerry's running mate in 2004. Kerry lost to incumbent President George W. Bush. Once running mates, Kerry and Edwards quickly severed their friendship after what was a disappointing election for Edwards. He quickly set his sights on Iowa, gearing up for another presidential bid in 2008. Edwards met Hunter in early 2006 at a bar at the Regency Hotel in New York City. Hunter approached Edwards, not believing it was him. Later that evening, Edwards and Hunter met again, privately. Overheard on CNN.com: 'Being a slimy dirtbag doesn't equal being a criminal' The man who constantly spoke about two Americas began living two lives. The 40-something Hunter told Edwards that she could help his campaign. Edwards hired her to produce a few videos that would present the politician in a more relaxed manner. The videos were called \"webisodes\" and were posted to Edwards' campaign site. However, instead of showing Edwards in a new light, the flirtatious on-camera banter only highlighted just how close Edwards and Hunter had become. Staffers began to suspect that Hunter had become more than a videographer to Edwards. That thought was fueled by Edwards' directive that Hunter be allowed to travel with him whenever either of them insisted. Josh Brumberger was Edwards' chief of staff during the time Hunter traveled with the campaign. On several occasions, he talked to Edwards about Hunter's involvement with the campaign. One heated altercation ended with Edwards firing Brumberger, and by the fall of 2006, several longtime senior aides left the campaign amid Edwards' refusal to end his relationship with Hunter, as detailed in \"Game Change,\" the book about the 2008 election. On December 28, 2006, Edwards launched his presidential campaign in New Orleans against the backdrop of a city trying to rebuild and revive itself. He vowed to strengthen the middle class, progressively end poverty and tackle the longstanding Democratic health care platform. But just as the campaign got off the ground, it hit turbulence. In March 2007, Elizabeth Edwards announced she had breast cancer for the second time, and it was incurable. Still, they decided to continue with the campaign. And in the weeks after the devastating discovery, internal campaign polling showed Edwards surging ahead of rivals Clinton and Obama in Iowa. Meanwhile, Hunter had become pregnant. And to complicate things, Edwards was swimming in a pool of bad press -- he had received $400 haircuts and had made a six-figure salary working for a hedge fund that was linked to subprime lending and foreclosed homes. Enter Rachel \"Bunny\" Mellon. The wealthy banking heiress and widow who was once a close friend of Jacqueline Kennedy had been a supporter of Edwards since the 2004 election. After already contributing to Edwards the maximum allowed by law, Mellon provided additional money. According to court documents, between June 2007 and January 2008, Mellon allegedly wrote personal checks payable to a friend, hiding that she was giving money to Edwards. The checks were made out to the wife of Edwards aide Andrew Young, in her maiden name, and were deposited into accounts controlled by her and Young. As Edwards and Young planned, Young allegedly used the money to provide Hunter with rent, furniture, care, living expenses, medical visits and prenatal care. In total, the now 101-year-old Mellon gave Edwards seven checks ranging from $10,000 to $200,000. On October 10, 2007, the National Enquirer ran its first story saying Edwards was having an affair. The next day while campaigning in Summerton, South Carolina, Edwards denied the report, calling it \"tabloid trash.\" With tabloid reporters and photographers chasing Hunter and publishing photos of her pregnant, a second wealthy donor came forward. Fred Baron, a wealthy Texas lawyer who is now deceased, was the national finance chair of the campaign. Court documents show that from December 2007 to January 2008, Baron allegedly wrote nine checks ranging from $9,000 to $58,000. The money was used for Young to hide a pregnant Hunter from the media, as he falsely claimed paternity for her child. Baron's money was used to charter a private jet for trips to Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Aspen, Colorado; San Diego and Santa Barbara, California. Things weren't faring better for Edwards on the campaign trail. He placed second in the Iowa caucuses, and following disappointing losses in New Hampshire and South Carolina, he ended his campaign for president on January 30, 2008. Amid rumors in Democratic circles that he was secretly trying to broker a deal for vice president or attorney general in a Clinton or Obama administration, reporters remained persistent and continued to ask Edwards if he was having an affair. In February 2008, Hunter's and Edwards' child was born. Six months later, after repeated denials, Edwards admitted he had an affair with Hunter in an August 8 interview with ABC. When asked in the interview if he was the father of Hunter's child, he responded, \"That is absolutely not true.\" While his name was not on the birth certificate, Edwards would eventually claim paternity and apologize for denying the baby was his child. In February 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged they had opened an investigation on Edwards regarding campaign finances. By this point, his more than 30-year marriage was falling apart. John and Elizabeth separated and lived apart until Elizabeth Edwards succumbed to breast cancer weeks before Christmas in 2010, with Edwards and their oldest daughter, Cate, at her bedside. For Edwards, life got worse. After testimony from a cast of former staffers, including Hunter and Young -- the latter having published a scandalous tell-all book -- a grand jury indicted Edwards on June 3, 2011. Edwards refused a plea bargain that would have given him a few months in prison but would have allowed him to keep his law license.\n",
      "17. (CNN) -- Mohamed Morsi is an American-educated engineer who vowed to stand for democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won the Egyptian presidency. He is also an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders \"vampires\" and \"killers.\" One analyst describes him as an \"icon\" of those seeking an \"extreme agenda.\" On Monday, the Muslim Brotherhood announced that Morsi, 60, had defeated his rival Ahmed Shafik, who briefly served as prime minister in the waning days of Mubarak's regime, in the weekend run-off election. The official vote count was scheduled to be finished at some point Monday, with final results to be announced Thursday . As during the run-up to the first-round vote in May, questions surround how much of a hard line Morsi would take, and in what direction he would steer the country. Morsi leads the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood -- which had been the most powerful political movement in the new Egyptian government. The group controlled about half of the seats in parliament before Egypt's highest court dissolved the legislative body Thursday. His party notes that he was arrested several times under President Hosni Mubarak's regime for protesting \"repressive measures and oppressive practices,\" as well as \"rigged elections.\" At one point, he spent seven months in jail. Analysts say Morsi is focusing his campaign on appealing to the broadest possible audience. But he \"represents the older, more conservative wing of the Brotherhood and openly endorses a strict Islamic vision,\" Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in a column for CNN.com. \"A vote for Mohamed Morsi will consolidate the Brotherhood's political influence, which could translate into a constitution with weaker provisions for protection of minority and women's rights.\" A slogan associated with his campaign, \"Islam is the solution,\" is sparking concerns that Morsi could introduce a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy. He told CNN last month that he had no such plans. His party seeks \"an executive branch that represents the people's true will and implements their public interests,\" Morsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Photos: Political turmoil in Egypt . \"There is no such thing called an Islamic democracy. There is democracy only. ... The people are the source of authority,\" he said. Asked about the role of women, he vowed that \"women's rights are equal to men.\" And asked whether he would maintain Egypt's 1979 accord with Israel, Morsi answered, \"Yes, of course I will. I will respect it provided the other side keep it up and respect it.\" Morsi was not originally his party's pick for the country's top post. He was called on to step in after the first choice was disqualified. Khairat al-Shater was among three candidates who were told they did not meet candidacy requirements. The Muslim Brotherhood had originally pledged not to seek the presidency, noted the Financial Times. \"It went back on its word, suspecting that its gains since the January 2011 revolution could be undermined by the military council that has ruled since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak.\" Morsi has served as a central behind-the-scenes player for much of the past decade, Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote in a column for The New Republic. He was the Brotherhood's primary point man for state security -- \"the repressive domestic security apparatus through which the Mubarak regime monitored and infiltrated opposition groups,\" Trager writes. \"Indeed, Brotherhood leaders trusted Morsi because they viewed him as ideologically rigid, and therefore unlikely to concede too much to the regime during negotiations.\" Morsi was also \"an icon of the extremists in the Muslim Brotherhood,\" pushing for an \"extreme agenda,\" Trager wrote. Morsi's official biography on the Freedom and Justice Party website describes him as \"one of the most prominent political leadership figures of the Brotherhood, the organization that led the struggle against the ousted repressive regime in its last decade.\" He led the Brotherhood's parliamentary bloc from 2000 to 2005 in addition to serving as president of the Department of Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering at Zagazig University. Morsi was arrested several times \"due to his constantly firm stance against the repressive measures and oppressive practices of the overthrown regime,\" the party said. \"After the 2005 elections were rigged, Dr. Mohamed Morsi led demonstrations in support for judges demanding independence, refusing referral of some judges to the Competence Commission to punish them for their outspoken views against blatant elections fraud.\" The following May, he was among 500 members of the Brotherhood arrested, the party said. Morsi spent seven months behind bars. \"He was arrested, yet again, on the morning of the 'Friday of Anger' on January 28, 2011, during the revolution of January 25 along with a large number of Brotherhood leaders across Egypt. ... When several prisons were destroyed during the revolution, and many prisoners escaped, Dr. Morsi refused to leave his prison cell. Instead, he contacted satellite TV channels and news agencies demanding the judicial authorities visit the prison and check the legal position of jailed Muslim Brotherhood leaders, to clarify if there were indeed any legal reasons for their arrest,\" the party website says. Morsi -- who has bachelor's and master's degrees from Cairo University and a doctorate from the University of Southern California -- insists that under his leadership, such abuses won't happen. There will be \"no need for worry at all over any kind of abusive power,\" he told CNN. \"It will be impossible to allow these kinds of abuse in the shadow of a constitutional state, a lawful state, a state that protects the dignity of a person.\" Analysts: 'Soft coup' court riling could reignite Egyptian revolution .\n",
      "18. Moscow (CNN) -- Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov -- the owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team and one of the world's richest men -- said Monday that he will run for president of Russia next year. Calling his decision to run for president \"probably the most important decision of my life,\" he acknowledged the risks of challenging Russia's rulers. \"There is saying in Russia: Never say never, anyone can end up behind bars. But I am not afraid,\" he said in a press conference in Moscow. Prokhorov, 45, is worth $18 billion, Forbes estimated in March, making him Russia's third richest man. Profile: Who is Mikhail Prokhorov? His announcement set off a frenzy of speculation about whether he was running with the Kremlin's tacit backing, to give the impression there was a genuine contest for president, or whether he really seeks to defeat Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who also says he will run. He told reporters he had not discussed his decision with Putin or President Dmitry Medvedev, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. Prokhorov, who has dabbled in opposition politics before, wrote just last week that Putin was the only person who could run the country. \"You may like it or not but Putin is the only person who can somehow manage this ineffective state machine,\" he wrote on his LiveJournal blog. A Prokhorov representative declined a CNN interview request on the businessman's behalf, saying Monday he wanted to focus on communicating with Russians via Russian media. Prokhorov's Onexim Group has interests in metal, financial services, media, real estate, utilities and high-tech businesses, according to the Nets. He weathered the 2008 global financial meltdown particularly well, and told CNN the following year it was partly due to luck. But, he also said, \"I like business. It's my profession. I spend, like, 15 hours a day in the office. It's the great joy in my life. And I never think about money.\" He laughed when CNN's Matthew Chance asked him what he thought of his reputation as a playboy. \"I don't care. I try to act natural,\" he said, adding he had \"no time\" to think about having a family. Forbes magazine described him as a \"six-foot-eight bachelor and martial arts buff\" in March, when it listed him as the 32nd richest man in the world. Separately, Putin backers demonstrated in support of his government Monday, after enormous crowds protested against the government over the weekend. Tens of thousands turned out Saturday to protest against election results that returned Putin's United Russia party to power. Police estimated crowds in Moscow at 25,000, while organizers said it would be 40,000, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Either figure would make the protests the largest in the Russian capital for decades. Claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged, protesters chanted \"Putin out,\" according to RIA Novosti. Protesters also braved freezing temperatures in other Russian cities to demonstrate against what they said was vote fraud. A day after the protests, Medvedev called for a probe into the allegations. \"I agree neither with the slogans nor the statements voiced at the protests,\" the statement on Medvedev's Facebook page said. \"Nevertheless, I have ordered checks into all the reports from polling stations, regarding the compliance with the election laws.\" Critics piled ridicule on the Facebook post. \"It's awful,\" Elena Panina wrote. \"Really. He was drunk when he wrote that or he didn't read what he wrote. ... What slogans does our president disagree with? 'We are for fair elections?'\" Vladimir Kaganovich said the statement showed Medvedev is in the wrong job. \"The president of the country isn't an individual person and doesn't have a right to show his disagreement with dozens of thousands of citizens,\" Kaganovich wrote. And he asked what it meant to launch a probe with no investigators and no time limit on the investigation. \"Please forgive me but it I wouldn't trust you even to manage a group in my department,\" Kaganovich wrote. And, addressing the president in the formal Russian manner, Sergey Pavlyuchenko simply wrote: \"Dear Dmitry Anatolievich! Are you ever ashamed?\" Putin's United Russia party suffered big losses in the election but retained its parliamentary majority, according to official results. The protesters demanded an annulment of the December 4 election and a new vote. Around 7,000 people rallied in St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, RIA Novosti said, citing police. Hundreds of protesters were arrested during demonstrations last week. Police said they cracked down on those demonstrations because the turnouts were not legal and the protesters were being disorderly. Election officials on Friday released the official election results: 238 seats for United Russia; 92 seats for the Communists; 64 seats for Fair Russia; and 56 seats for the Liberal Democrats. Putin has announced plans to run for president -- the office he used to hold -- when Medvedev's term expires early next year. CNN's Arkady Irshenko and Phil Black contributed to this report from Moscow. CNN's Richard Allen Greene reported from London.\n",
      "19. London (CNN) -- Former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond has hit back at British lawmakers who suggested he misled them over concerns voiced by the country's financial regulators. CNN can also reveal that those very same regulators will now be called to testify next week alongside a key Barclays executive, who Diamond said had mistakenly told traders to lower their submissions to the London Interbank Offered Rate -- or Libor. Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority watchdog, has been been called to the Treasury Select Committee Monday afternoon with the head of the FSA's bank supervisory body Andrew Bailey, the man famous for warning Barclays of failings in its culture. Turner and Bailey will appear after panel members take a pre-arranged briefing from the Bank of England Governor Mervyn King. Officially King is slated to present the central bank's quarterly update on the UK economy and interest rates. However, sources say the discussions are likely to focus heavily on the issue of Libor after King's deputy Paul Tucker refuted suggestions he leaned on Barclays to lower its rate submissions. Jerry Del Missier, former Barclays Chief Operating Officer, will also give evidence Monday, in what is likely to be the most keenly watched testimony of all. Diamond's right-hand man also quit last week after the bank was fined a record Â£290 million (US$449 million) for fixing the interest rate floor upon which trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts are based. Diamond gives up $31 million bonuses . Del Missier will come in for questioning about claims he misread an email from Diamond asking him to lower Libor submissions following a conversation between Diamond and Tucker. Questions also remain about whether or not Diamond was aware of correspondence between the FSA and Barclays about the bank's alleged use of financial structures \"at the aggressive end of interpretation of the relevant rules.\" At the time of writing, four out of the 13 lawmakers on the committee charged with investigating the Libor scandal said they would like to see Diamond be recalled to clarify his earlier statements. Inside Barclays: Morale at all time low . In a letter obtained by CNN from Diamond to UK Treasury Select Committee Chairman Andrew Tyrie dated July 10, the 60-year-old American-born banker seemed keen to get a second chance to speak. Diamond said the comments made at the hearing had had \"a terribly unfair impact\" upon his reputation, a reputation which Diamond said was \"of paramount concern to me.\" He added: 'I look forward to discussing this issue with you further if you wish to do so.\" Yet those close to the parliamentary body say it is unlikely Diamond will have a second chance to put on a polished appearance because the committee is due to be reshuffled next week. \"It's not the complexities of this that are the problem. It's the evidence that's the problem,\" said one unnamed member. \"Also time is working against us.\" Another doubted Diamond would become embroiled in the Serious Fraud Office's recently launched Libor probe, even if sources at Barclays confirmed to CNN they are bound by Diamond's contract to cover his legal costs, should he face any. All the while Diamond has waived his right to Â£20 million (US$31 million) in deferred compensation and bonus payments, walking away instead with a tenth of that amount. John Mann MP, a lawmaker and member of the committee that interrogated Diamond last week, said: \"You only give up your job and your pay if you've got no cards to play. \"This has never been how Bob Diamond has ever operated.\" Bob E. Diamond Jr's letter to Treasury Select Committee Chairman Andrew Tyrie . July 10, 2012 . Dear Mr Tyrie, . Having watched the Committee's session today I was dismayed that you and some of your fellow Committee members appear to have suggested that I was less than candid with the Committee last week. Any such suggestion would be totally unfair and unfounded. The focus of your concern appears to relate to correspondence between Messrs. Turner and Agius in April 2012. The questions asked of me, however, concerned the period of promotion in September 2010 and the board meeting I attended in February 2012. As the letters of April 2012 make clear, those letters followed an April meeting between Messrs. Turner and Agius, which I did not attend. I was not asked about the April 2012 meeting nor was I asked about, nor shown, the follow up letter to that April meeting at our session. I trust this addresses any concerns you may have had. The comments made at today's hearing have had a terribly unfair impact upon my reputation, which is of paramount concern to me. I look forward to discussing this issue with you further if you wish to do so. Yours sincerely, . B. Diamond (signature)\n",
      "20. Hong Kong (CNN) -- Beijing has clamped down on information once publicly available on listed and state-owned companies, hurting the effort of Western investors and companies to gauge whether to invest in -- or short-sell -- Chinese firms. First reported by the International Financial Law Review, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce now requires company permission before accessing records such as financial reports and shareholder information. Companies that sell credit reports -- which give companies a quick read on the background of the firm they are considering doing business with -- have been hindered, said Peter Humphrey, managing director of ChinaWhys, an international business risk advisory firm in Beijing. \"They are restricted now. They cannot include personal identity information about individual shareholders or financial data from the last three years,\" he said. \"There is a major impact as many companies consume thousands of these reports every year, and that kind of information is no longer there, and it is not possible to get a reliable credit rating on this or that business partner without knowing how it's performing financially and who owns it.\" Many believe the move may be in part a backlash against hedge funds like Muddy Waters Research, which prominently took down Chinese timber company Sino-Forest. The hedge fund has led similar short-selling crusade against other North American-listed Chinese firms such as including Focus Media, Rino International, China MediaExpress and Duoyuan Global Water, as CNNMoney reported. All were delisted after Muddy Waters' withering reports, with the exception of Focus Media. But the information clampdown also comes at a sensitive time for Chinese leadership as it readies for its once-a-decade transfer of leadership at the top as President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, who are both in their final year of office. Also in the backdrop is the public rise and fall of Bo Xilai, a rising star who was dismissed as Communist Party chief of Chongqing, the biggest metropolis in China. His right-hand man and former top cop Wang Lijun spectacularly sought refuge in an American consulate apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information on his old boss. His wife, Gu Kailai, is also being investigated on suspicion of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a \"conflict over economic interests,\" according to state media. Subsequent reports suggest Bo's family was worth millions of dollars through business dealings and powerful political connections. Difficulties getting access to information on companies \"began at the beginning of this year, and it became a lot worse after the Bo Xilai scandal,\" said Humphrey, who is founding president of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners in Mainland China. \"The people offering due diligence services to multi-nationals considering relationships with Chinese companies are finding certain information to complete the picture is now missing when they are assessing a company for investment purposes,\" he said. \"This is a handicap to people investing in China right now. It is linked to the political atmosphere of this year's leadership transition period, which has made China more tense, and the gathering of legitimate business information more sensitive.\" The move to limit public information on companies comes after the April arrest of 1,700 suspects in a widespread crackdown on the illegal selling of personal information, the Shanghai Daily reported, including an official in Baoding who sold large amounts registered company information. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., which provides commercial information on businesses for credit checks, suspended its Shanghai-based market research company, Shanghai Roadway D&B Services Co., earlier this year after allegations after a Chinese report it illegally collected information on 150 million people, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n",
      "21. (RollingStone.com) -- It's instructive to note what a killer actor Richard Gere can be when a movie rises to his level. \"Arbitrage\" is such a movie, a sinfully entertaining look at the sins committed in the name of money. For proof that we're in financial hell, look around. True, this territory has been covered from Wall Street to last year's \"Margin Call.\" But Gere and first-time director Nicholas Jarecki put a tantalizing spin on what goes on in the head of a fraudulent hedge-fund manager when he decides to stick it to the rest of us, including his own family. Gere's Robert Miller is the picture of unflappable elegance. Good job on that, since he's just lost $400 million in a bad copper-mine investment, and if he can't cover it up and unload his company on a major bank, his career will go kaput along with his fortune. Fraud puts pressure on Robert's skill at deceiving wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), French mistress Julie (Laetitia Casta) and chief accountant Brooke (Brit Marling), who also happens to be his daughter. But Robert keeps his cool until the sudden death of one of these women has him dodging a possible murder rap with the grudging help of Jimmy Grant (a terrific Nate Parker), the son of the family chauffeur and the only black man in Robert's circle of white privilege. That's when NYPD detective Michael Bryer (Tim Roth) smells a rat and Robert's world begins to unravel. There's enough plot here to stuff a miniseries or three, yet \"Arbitrage\" never descends to bland and predictable. Credit Jarecki, whose combustible directing debut gives \"Arbitrage\" the charge of a thriller and the provocation of a moral fable. Jarecki has an eye for the telling detail, not surprising given his start with the 2005 documentary \"The Outsider\" (about rogue director James Toback). Docs run in the Jarecki family, with half brothers Andrew (\"Capturing the Friedmans\") and Eugene (\"Why We Fight\") making notable contributions to the genre. As the son of two commodities traders, Jarecki has Wall Street in his DNA. And it resonates in his exceptional screenplay, which potently captures the gleaming seduction of Robert's world and the fear that festers underneath. Jarecki knows the territory. And Gere knows the man, inside and out. His rapt, watchful performance is a thing of toxic beauty. Gere digs so deep into this flawed tycoon that we come to understand Robert's actions without for a minute forgiving them. Wearing the trappings of wealth like a second skin, Gere invites us to see what Robert sees. And the glamour in his field of vision -- cheers to cinematographer Yorick Le Saux (I Am Love) for the sheen and composer Cliff Martinez (Drive) for the seductive mood -- is tempting enough to make us all complicit. Like the best movies, \"Arbitrage\" persuades us to ask tough questions about ourselves. And Gere nails every nuance in a role that holds up a dark mirror to the way we live now. Despite his box-office success in crowd-pleasers such as \"An Officer and a Gentleman,\" \"Pretty Woman\" and \"Chicago,\" Gere has long been underrated. No Academy love, not even for his sinister brilliance in \"Internal Affairs,\" \"American Gigolo\" and \"The Hoax,\" or for the battered heart he brought to the cheated-on husband in \"Unfaithful.\" Gere's performance in \"Arbitrage\" is too good to ignore. At 62, he is at the peak of his powers. Watch him in the scene when Sarandon -- in full, feisty flower -- hits Robert with a lifetime of resentments. She can't rock his composure. But Gere gives us a window into the soul of a man who finally realizes that even money will no longer help him lie to himself. It's an implosive tour de force. See full story at RollingStone.com.

      "22. Washington (CNN) -- Step by step, die-hard conservatives are confronting their grief over President Barack Obama's re-election. But judging from blog posts and other public pronouncements, many remain stuck somewhere between denial and anger, very far from acceptance. So far this week, prolific blogger Judson Phillips on Tea Party Nation has called for boycotting the Electoral College to prevent validating the election result and lamented the triumph of liberalism in destroying national unity and therefore America's greatness. Over at RedState.com, a more sophisticated political analysis echoes calls by Republican leaders to better communicate conservative principles instead of softening or dropping them. Founder and CNN contributor Erick Erickson, who rejected any talk of electoral fraud or an unfair Obama victory, wrote Tuesday that \"there'll be no hand-wringing here and there sure as hell won't be any apologies for fighting for what we believe in.\" \"Republicans are not successful when they run campaigns as the rich patrician out to make government more efficient so it can be more helpful,\" said another Erickson post Tuesday. \"Republicans win with conservative populists who run as men who pulled themselves up in life fighting big government and its cronies.\" Some acceptance has been necessary. On Tuesday, tea party favorite Rep. Allen West of Florida conceded in his race for re-election after initially alleging electoral fraud. Little of the discussion focuses on the changing demographics of the country, identified by exit polls and many analysts as a major factor in both Obama's 2008 victory to become the nation's first African-American president and his re-election on November 6. In particular, Obama received overwhelming support from the nation's fastest-growing demographic -- Hispanic Americans -- to cause some high-profile conservatives including Fox radio and television host Sean Hannity to soften their stance on immigration reform. Overall, though, hard-core conservatives continue to reject that they are a minority in a country built on the core principle of liberty that they embrace. Instead, the initial reactions and subsequent attempts to explain what happened sought scapegoats, such as what right-wing critics describe as a deficient Republican challenger in Mitt Romney, electoral theft or a liberal-dominated media industry that is part of a broader Marxist effort dating back decades to undermine the nation. Study: Fox, MSNBC got more extreme . On November 10, Phillips alleged that more votes than registered voters in several Florida precincts were part of Democratic efforts to \"steal the election\" against West. There was no immediate posting Tuesday in response to West's concession. Six days later, Phillips took aim at Romney, calling the former Massachusetts governor a \"flip-flopping liberal who ran a content-free campaign.\" In a response to Phillips' post, one writer ranted about what he alleged were \"the sexual perversions and drug use of the Obamas,\" the president's \"forged birth certificate\" and \"voter fraud of biblical proportions.\" \"Why are we talking secession instead of removing the New York Times and supporting citizens' Grand Jury indicments against this unbelievable treason, felonies and usurpations raining down on us on a daily basis?\" said the post attributed to Royce Latham of Penngrove, California. Timothy Stanley: Don't dismiss secession talk . On Sunday, Phillips proposed an action plan -- getting Electoral College voters in states won by Romney to boycott the validation of the election result by the December 17 deadline. \"The 12th Amendment specifies the quorum or the necessary number of states for the College to act, is 2/3,\" Phillips wrote. \"In other words, if 17 states refuse to participate, the Electoral College does not have a quorum.\" Without a quorum to decide the presidency, he continued, the Republican-led U.S. House will decide and presumably choose Romney. Phillips acknowledged such a move would set a \"dangerous precedent,\" but added that \"the situation is so grim we really have no other choice.\" \"Does anyone really believe America can survive four more years of Barack Obama?\" he wrote, saying the president will seek to \"transform America from that shining city on a hill into a third world shantytown, with massive unemployment and a corrupt government.\" What's next for Obama election organization? The next day, Phillips sounded more resigned, lamenting what he called \"the triumph of liberalism in America\" that he said was \"destroying our national unity and by extension destroying the freedom.\" \"In America, until now we have always identified ourselves as Americans,\" he wrote. \"The balkanization that has been pushed by the hard left has one goal in mind. That is the end of America as a great nation. They are perilously close to succeeding.\" Tuesday brought his attack on a carbon tax being discussed by some on both sides in Congress as a step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contributed to climate change. While challenging \"the mythical man-made global warming,\" Phillips also said a carbon tax would create a \"massive new tax stream\" for liberals bent on growing government. U.N.: Greenhouse gases set record in 2011 . The focus on a single issue certain to generate legislative and public debate signaled some change in the response to the election. To Phillips and other conservatives, any increase in revenue goes against their goal of shrinking the federal government by cutting spending. \"It is time for conservative activists to make the case to the American people that we have far more government than we can afford, or than we want, no matter what our politicians may think, or what deals they may be willing to cut with each other to keep spending other people's money until we are all bankrupt,\" said a Tuesday post on Tea Party Nation by Bruce Donnelly of Fox River Grove, Illinois. GOP, Dems seek common ground on fiscal cliff . Donnelly called for \"organizing voters to rein in the politicians, rather than let them keep playing the game by their rules with our money.\" \"It's worth your effort to organize voters in your community and apply real political pressure for change, because if we just keep playing the game by their rules, your own financial situation will keep getting worse, rather than better,\" he continued. \"The politicians keep offering free stuff with other people's money, playing us all for fools. It's time to wake up the voters in every corner of America to the fact that they have been conned by these snake oil salesmen and their well-rehearsed lies and false promises,\" Donnelly said. In the end, a reviled Democrat in the White House may mean more followers of conservative websites such as Tea Party Nation and RedState.com. No one seems happy about the better business prospects, at least for now.\n",
      "23. NEW YORK (CNN) -- In the midst of Wall Street's agonizing slide last week, there was at least one place in Manhattan where the liquor was flowing, the cigar smoke was billowing and the theme of the evening was simple: Work hard. Play hard. \"I was a crook,\" says Jordan Belfort, once a Wall Street fat cat who made $1 million a week before going to jail. \"It's like fiddling. Nero fiddled while Rome burned,\" said Thomas Graf, vice president and producer of Northmarq Capital. \"We're smoking cigars while we're losing our shirts, literally.\" He was among hundreds of mid-level Wall Street executives and traders gathered for a party thrown by Cigar Report magazine, published by New York-based Doubledown Media. And if they seemed a little tone-deaf about how this kind of event could be perceived as millions of dollars were lost, at least on paper, most did not seem especially concerned. \"It is a great time,\" said Adam Marsh of Empire Capital Partners. \"I think for at least a couple of hours in the evening, we can kind of sit back, have a few drinks, forget what's facing us on the Street tomorrow.\" Few of the men and women at the party earned millions in Wall Street bonuses on top of their salaries. But nearly all did very well, they say, at the top of the Wall Street bubble. And their bosses, along with those who managed Wall Street hedge funds, did even better. \"These guys were spending more than $250 billion a year,\" Robert Frank said. \"They bought mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach. They bought art for $100 million a painting.\" Frank, author of \"Richistan,\" says the enormous amounts of money earned by Wall Street elite made them practically a nation unto themselves. \"They just looked at the guy with the bigger house, the nicer Ferrari, the better artwork,\" he said. \"And it was all competitive spending.\" One prominent example is the CEO of Lehman Brothers, Richard Fuld. In 2007 alone, according to the executive compensation firm Equilar, he earned total take-home compensation of more than $45 million in salary and bonuses. Congressional researchers said he earned nearly $500 million from 2000 through 2007. Fuld told Congress that the failure of his company centered on inaction on the part of government and a loss of confidence in the financial markets. \"This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life, regardless of what comes out of this committee, regardless of when the record books get written,\" Fuld told Congress during a recent hearing. Not every Wall Street executive played by the books. Jordan Belfort was once chairman of a brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont. In the early to mid-'90s, he called himself the Wolf of Wall Street. He was jailed on federal charges of securities fraud and money laundering. He spent 22 months behind bars and was released in 2005. \"I was a crook,\" Belfort said. At one time, he says, he was earning more than $1 million a week. Now, he has been ordered to pay back $110 million to his victims, and he said he is working on that. Even the man who first chronicled Wall Street excess to a national audience can barely believe what has happened. Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the film \"Wall Street\" 21 years ago, says the main character in his story, unprincipled stockbroker Gordon Gekko, has been overtaken by reality. \"I never thought it would go to this level,\" Stone told CNN's Larry King. \"I thought the Gordon Gekkos of the world would die out. But they got worse.\" So what exactly did the new Gordon Gekkos do to earn those fabulous sums? \"What they really did was to figure out new and clever ways of investing,\" Frank said. \"Of creating financial products that very few of us could understand.\" \"On Wall Street, there's no cost. The only cost is the employees, the executives,\" said Andy Serwer, managing editor of Fortune magazine. \"So if a firm is creating a financial product that it can sell for $5 million, the person who sells it will get $2 million.\" But people who earned relatively little on Wall Street are now paying the price as well. Win Hornig, a 25-year-old Minnesotan who worked at both Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan, is now out of a job. He's launched a Web site called BankerGoneBroke.com to talk about it. \"My life was basically a disaster,\" Hornig said. \"I was working all the time, didn't have a lot to show for it. I came to the conclusion that there was more to life than money.\" While it lasted, the good times on Wall Street made money for traders and, of course, for Americans who had invested in the stock market, mainly through their 401(k) contributions. But there is a \"new normal\" these days. \"The party is over on Wall Street -- until it comes back again,\" Serwer said. \"I've been around long enough to see that we have these cycles. These guys get their cigars and champagne. They have a great time. The whole thing blows up. But then they re-emerge years later. This one is a really, really bad one. But I don't think Wall Street is dead.\"\n",
      "24. Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Tony Louzado is facing foreclosure. He's not alone -- in central Florida, where Louzado lives and works, one in every 56 homes is in foreclosure. That simple number, from foreclosure data firm RealtyTrac, doesn't tell the whole story, especially in Louzado's case. Two different law firms are pushing the foreclosure -- on the same mortgage. \"I see now that there's two people that are coming after me, that maybe [the bank] hired in this way,\" he said. \"I don't know all the specifics, but there's two people that are coming after me on the same loan number.\" Across the country, millions of Americans have lost their homes to foreclosure since the recession began in December 2007, according to RealtyTrac. Increasingly, however, more of those stories are becoming horror tales about a system in chaos with banks pushing people toward foreclosure, sometimes, allegedly, based on error-filled or even fraudulent and illegal documents. Several of the nation's financial giants, including Bank of America, Allied Financial, JPMorgan Chase and GMAC, have halted foreclosures, although Bank of America and GMAC announced they are resuming the process. While the Obama administration opposes a moratorium on foreclosures so the process can be examined, the federal Fraud Enforcement Task Force has launched a criminal investigation to determine if the banks and their lawyers have done anything illegal. Louzado's case may or may not have been handled properly, but his story is typical. \"I bought the house 6 years ago. It was something I was happy with. It was $1,500 a month,\" said the physical therapist and part-time fireman-paramedic. \"I'm a prideful man. I take pride in paying all my bills.\" But then, there were a series of tragic turns. His young son needed three open heart surgeries as well as other surgeries to drain fluid. Louzado's health insurance is good, he said, but not good enough to cover $1,800 per month in prescriptions, co-payments and deductibles. He took a loan from his retirement account. The low interest rate on his mortgage -- supposedly fixed for the first five years and variable after that -- nevertheless rose every year, including a $600 jump in Year 4. The bank had no real answers, he said, and wasn't very helpful. Meanwhile, the bills piled up, and he started to fall behind. Louzado took a 5 percent pay cut at the fire department, necessitated by the struggling economy. But still, he thought he could work his way out until he began calling his bank and realizing, he said, no one wanted to listen. \"They said, 'You are a hard-working American, thank you for paying us. When you stop paying, now we can start working with you,'\" Louzado said. \"Basically, do something wrong, then we're going to work with you. Go through your savings, go through everything, now you have nothing. \"With my situation it's a little more difficult because of my son's surgeries and the medical bills which I now have to take care of, which I want to take care of,\" His son's medical bills take priority, Louzado says. But that's not easy with a big bank seeking to repossess his modest, three-bedroom townhome in Miami -- and two law firms to deal with. \"In my opinion, these are hired guns. Banks want these non-performing loans off their bottom line. And what do they do? They go out and hire a foreclosure mill who's trying to push it through as fast as possible,\" said Louzado's attorney, Jose Funica. Working fast and furiously creates opportunities for mistakes, Funica said, and Florida foreclosure defense attorneys are filing complaints. Funica's Palm Beach law firm, Ice Legal, has taken numerous depositions where banking officials have admitted under oath they signed thousands of foreclosure-related documents every month without personally verifying them. One employee was signing 10,000 documents a month in some cases, the depositions revealed. \"That's virtually impossible,\" said Funica. \"You have to have an army of people to review the documents necessary to prove the validity of these documents in court.\" One of the firms foreclosing on Louzado is the law office of David Stern in Plantation, Florida. Florida's attorney general says Stern's foreclosure business is the largest in the state and accuses the firm of submitting false documents, even making some up, just to speed up the foreclosure process. The state has opened a civil investigation against several firms, including Stern's. Repeated calls to Stern's office have not been returned. However, he told the New York Times, \" ... there has not been submission of fraudulent documents.\" Stern said the investigation is politically motivated, adding, \"We have done nothing wrong.\" \"I can tell you now that no misconduct is occurring at David Stern's law firm, and the firm works very diligently to make sure that all the processing is done correctly,\" Stern's attorney, Jeffrey Tew, said in a phone interview. But in depositions for a lawsuit against the firm, Stern's employees admitted, under oath, they were signing foreclosure documents so fast that they barely had time to even see who the homeowner was. It's a practice known as \"robo-signing.\" In an excerpt from a deposition of Cheryl Samons, an employee who once worked for Stern, she says she did not read foreclosure documents before signing them. \"How much time do you spend examining each document before you sign them?\" asked Ice Legal. \"Very little,\" the employee answered. \"Do you read the document?\" Ice Legal asked. \"No,\" the employee answered. \"Their mill is the printer, printing off document after document after document and just having people sign them,\" said Ice Legal attorney Chris Immel. \"They're being paid to serve, to take the foreclosure through the process as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"The servicers actually rate them based on how quickly they move through the process.\" And in a \"foreclosure mill,\" time is money. \" ... $1,200 to $1,450 is usually what shows up on uncontested cases for attorney's fees and costs because they're dealing with a pro-se person who's not challenging the different paperwork that they file in the case,\" said Immel. \"I mean, some of these people are making a very good living doing this.\" David Stern has made millions. He owns tens of millions of dollars in homes, sports-cars and a recently purchased a 130-foot Mangusta yacht. The yacht alone is estimated to be worth around $20 million. Judges in numerous states have thrown out thousands of foreclosures. In at least six states, attorneys general are investigating, including the state of Ohio which has also sued Allied Financial. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has announced the Department of Justice is looking into the problem, and Congressional leaders are calling for GAO investigations and more. The investigations and lawsuits will eventually peel back the layers and determine if the foreclosures have been handled properly. Congress may set more rules so that the system operates more transparently. But that will all come too late for Tony Louzado, who has given up the fight to keep his home and reluctantly is letting it go. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

      "25. (CNN) -- A Canadian fugitive is in police custody, nabbed 14 years after and more than 1,600 miles from where authorities say he gunned down a man in cold blood. John Boulachanis, 37, was arrested Thursday in Miami, according to a news release issued Saturday by the U.S. Marshals Service. According to a website run by Quebec's provincial government, in August 1997 Boulachanis and an accomplice lured Robert Tanguay to a sandpit in the Rigaud region in the western part of the province between Montreal and Ottawa. There, Canadian authorities allege that Boulachanis used a .22-caliber firearm and shot Tanguay several times in the head. The victim's body was buried and wasn't discovered until September 2001. The accomplice was eventually arrested, but the primary suspect -- Boulachanis -- remained at large. He was spotted in New Jersey in 2009, the U.S. Marshals Service said in its statement, citing the Surete du Quebec homicide squad. But he fled before he could be definitively identified and arrested. Last April, Canada's Interpol branch requested fresh assistance from their American counterparts, based in Washington, for help in tracking down Boulachanis. Investigators determined a month later that he had eluded capture \"by assembling a complex labyrinth of intentional disinformation, telephone numbers, addresses, financial accounts and postal boxes in Canada and the United States,\" according to the U.S. Marshals statement. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police notes on its website that the 5-foot-9, 155-pound man assumed a host of aliases over the years, including John Athanassopoulos, John Smith, Konstaninos Georgakopolous, John Papas and John Russo. Besides first-degree murder, Boulachanis is accused in Canada of fraud, arson, narcotics trafficking, conspiracy and weapons-related offenses. He is also wanted in Franklin County, Virginia, on a felony fugitive warrant and on three counts of obtaining money under false pretenses. \"The arrest of Boulachanis shows that, no matter how far this fugitive ran, he couldn't escape the coordinated, international effort to apprehend him,\" said Geoff Shank, from the U.S. Marshals Service's investigative division, in a statement.\n",
      "26. Paris (CNN) -- In politics, a week may feel like an eternity. Exactly a week ago, French President Francois Hollande suffered a momentous blow, the first real shock of his presidency. His recently dismissed Budget Minister, Jerome Cahuzac, a former hair implant surgeon-turned-socialist, confessed on his blog that he had been lying for the last four months and that he had, in fact, a hidden Swiss bank account which the French inland revenue services never knew about. In other words, the man in charge of tackling tax evasion was admitting to being a fraudster. Not only this, but he had lied outright in parliament, in front of the nation's representatives. To utter lies in Parliament may not constitute a crime (unlike in the USA, there is no such thing as perjury in France), however, the French were shocked to discover that a minister had had the nerve to deny the truth in the Republic's most symbolic and sacred of places. A few hours later, Hollande pre-recorded a message to his fellow countrymen. He would take immediate measures, he said, to restore the country's confidence in its political class and, no, he knew nothing of his Budget minister's wrongdoings. From left to right, everyone in France was reeling from the news. Polls suggested that 65% of the French wanted Parliament to be dissolved and new elections to take place, others that 60% of the French people wanted, at the very least, a cabinet reshuffle or change of government. While Hollande had to leave for an official two-day visit to Morocco, his Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that anyone found guilty of tax-dodging would be banned from holding public office. The opposition immediately accused Pierre Moscovici, the economy minister to whom Cahuzac reported, of acting too slowly, and too late. Mediapart, the news website which broke the story over Cahuzac's Swiss account last November, asserted that Moscovici had effectively tried to shield his colleague. The atmosphere became toxic; rumours started circulating about other potential tax fraudsters serving in government. Daily newspaper Liberation was this week heavily criticised for making allegations without giving any evidence. Today, its editor apologised and recognized his mistake. In another televised message -- the second within a week -- Hollande gave his ministers until Monday April 15 to reveal their personal assets; parliament is to consider a bill making such disclosures compulsory for the entire political class. Until now, France and Slovenia were the only two countries to have opted out from this measure of financial transparency, already implemented at a European level. President Hollande also announced that he was creating a new agency to fight financial fraud, and appointing a special prosecutor to deal with financial crime. He said banks would now be forced to detail all their activities in tax havens, with the publication of all their international affiliates and subsidiaries, country by country. A few discordant voices from Nicolas Sarkozy's right-wing UMP party complained that revealing private assets amounted to \"voyeurism\" and \"hypocrisy\". Resorting to irony, Jean-Marie le Pen of the far-right Front National declared on national radio: \"My Swiss bank account was always known to the French tax revenue and I wear pants made in France\". However, the mood of the public in France is very much in favor of a moralization of public life and Hollande's measures have been received with guarded optimism. It is indeed not the first time a French president has promised to crush immorality in politics. \"L'Affaire Cahuzac\" has struck French consciences as deeply as Dominique Strauss-Kahn's sex scandal in 2011. Tax evasion, a national sport in France till the 1980s and a massive crackdown by then Prime Minister Raymond Barre, was thought, in the main, to be a thing of the past. But suddenly it has made a come-back at the most sensitive of times. France has 3 million unemployed people and faces deep economic problems, including a loss of competitiveness. Could Hollande's government fall over this sleaze scandal? It could if more tax evasion revelations affecting members of the government were to come out but it probably won't if it acts swiftly and Cahuzac remains the only black sheep on the horizon. The question now is, will Hollande take advantage of \"L'affaire\" to form a new government with a new prime minister? Significantly, centrist FranÃ§ois Bayrou, whose last-minute decision to back FranÃ§ois Hollande was a crucial factor in Hollande's presidential election victory, and who has campaigned for years to clean up French political life, made a public statement and declared himself ready to serve. Having reached a new low in the popularity polls, with only 27% of the French supporting him, President Hollande may be tempted to look for a new Prime Minister with a strong image of integrity.

      "27. (CNN) -- He is accused of killing innocent civilians, including women and children, in their homes in two Afghan villages. The accusations are met with bewilderment from a number of those who know U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who bears the scars from wounds he received in three previous tours in Iraq. His friends and family say he remained passionately committed to serving his country and cared deeply for others. \"Regardless of what happened, Bobby has been changed forever,\" said Bob Durham, who knew Bales when he was growing up in Ohio. \"If the Bobby that I knew ever gets well, comes back to it, and realizes what has happened, and realizes that children and women were killed, I don't think he can live with it. He'll never be the same. He's such a great person ... that crushes me.\" Retired general: Incident could speed disengagement . And in a statement released Monday afternoon, Bales' wife, Karilyn, said what has been reported so far \"is completely out of character of the man I know and admire.\" \"Please respect me when I say I cannot shed any light on what happened that night, so please do not ask,\" she said. \"I, too, want to know what happened. I want to know how this could be.\" Karilyn Bales extended the family's condolences to the people of the Afghan villages where the killings took place, \"especially to the parents, brothers, sisters and grandparents of the children who perished.\" \"I know that all good people around the world, regardless of nationality, religion or political values, join me in grieving that such a terrible thing could happen,\" she said. \"The victims and their families are all in my prayers, as is my husband who I love very much.\" Bales, who is in his late 30s, is accused of leaving a remote U.S. combat post on foot before dawn on March 11 and gunning down Afghans in their homes. In all, 16 villagers were killed, nine of them children. Bales has not been formally charged, though the military has made a determination of probable cause. He met Monday with his defense attorney, John Henry Browne of Seattle, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where the Army staff sergeant was taken on Friday. Villagers describe horror of slaughter . The deaths have outraged Afghans and strained already tense relations between the two nations. They also shocked those who know and love Bales, including his wife and two children. \"Sgt. Bales' family is stunned in the face of this tragedy, but they stand behind the man they know as a devoted husband, father and dedicated member of the armed services,\" attorney Emma Scanlan said Saturday in a statement. Bales grew up and attended school in Norwood, a Cincinnati suburb of about 19,000 residents. As a teenager, Durham recalled, Bales helped care for Durham's severely disabled son. Bales, a popular football player, never hesitated to take the younger boy along wherever he was headed, Durham said. \"I love the guy,\" he said. \"He's a part of my family. I've known him since the day he was born.\" After Bales was graduated from Norwood High School in 1991, he played football while attending the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, according to two family friends. Records indicate he lived at multiple addresses in the Columbus area in the ensuing years. Bales began working as a broker, passing his general securities representative exam in 1996 and the uniform securities agent state law exam the following year. But a customer dispute in 2000 resulted in a big loss. According to a BrokerCheck report from the Financial industry Regulatory Authority, he was accused of making unauthorized trades; failure to provide competent and professional services; breach of contractual and legal duties; unsuitability; misrepresentations and omission of material fact and breach of fiduciary duty. Arbitration found in 2003 that he had engaged in fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unauthorized trading, unsuitable investments and churning. The latter occurs when a broker engages in frequent buying and selling in a customer's account primarily to generate commissions. He was ordered to pay claimant $637,000 as compensatory damages plus interest and $637,000 as punitive damages. Bales was not solely responsible for repaying the money. A company and another individual were held jointly responsible. Bales joined the Army two months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and in September 2002 was assigned to Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, the military has said. Also in 2002, public records show he had a brush with the law, facing a criminal assault charge in a Tacoma court. He pleaded not guilty. Bales completed anger management treatment and the case was dismissed the following year, court records show. The victim was not named in the records, and no details about the case were immediately available. Tacoma Police Officer Naveed Benjamin said the incident took place at a Tacoma casino. He first deployed to Iraq in 2003, then again in 2006, serving 15 consecutive months as part of then-President George W. Bush's \"surge\" of 20,000 additional troops. During that second tour, Browne has said, Bales was wounded and underwent the amputation of part of his foot. An Army account recalled a 2007 incident in Iraq, when an operation to recover a helicopter shot down near Najaf turned into more of a humanitarian mission to help wounded civilians. According to the account, Bales -- then serving as a team leader -- said he was \"proud\" and that his unit \"discriminated between the bad guys and the noncombatants and then afterward we ended up helping the people that three or four hours before were trying to kill us.\" \"I think that's the real difference between being an American as opposed to being a bad guy, someone who puts his family in harm's way like that,\" said Bales in the account, published online in February 2009. He deployed to Iraq a third time between 2009 and 2010, according to the military. He suffered a traumatic brain injury when his vehicle flipped after striking a roadside bomb, his attorney said. The Army summary lists multiple decorations for Bales, including three Army \"good conduct\" medals. Bales' family was \"not happy\" about his fourth deployment, this time to Afghanistan, his attorney has said. \"He was told that he was not going to be redeployed,\" Brown said. Taliban demand trial in Afghanistan . They were also disappointed that he was not promoted to sergeant first class, according to blog posts written by his wife a year ago and published Friday by the Tacoma News-Tribune. \"It is very disappointing after all of the work Bob has done and all the sacrifices he has made for his love of his country, family and friends,\" Karilyn Bales wrote. \"I am sad and disappointed too, but I am also relieved, we can finally move on to the next phase of our lives.\" The family was preparing to move last year, hoping to be stationed in Germany, Italy, Hawaii, Kentucky -- which, Karilyn Bales noted, would be \"near Bob's family\" -- or Georgia, \"to be a sniper teacher,\" she wrote of her husband, according to the newspaper. However, records show the family was under financial pressure and was forced to put their Lake Tapps, Washington, home on the market last week for $229,000 -- less than the $280,000 they purchased it for in 2006. Moving vans were outside the home on Monday. The Baleses were \"happy\" and \"normal,\" according to neighbor Cassie Holland. \"We would go over there for birthday parties and they would come to my kids' birthday parties,\" she said. \"I would describe (Bales) as super fun to hang around with, kind of the life of the party kind of guy. Super loving, great with his kids. I don't see how this has happened.\" Before buying the home, the family owned a townhouse in a modest, middle-class neighborhood in Auburn, Washington, about 30 minutes from the military base. Tim Burgess, whose townhouse shared a wall with the Baleses, said Bales was \"a really good guy (who) just wanted to serve.\" \"I know he just wanted to go back and serve overseas, that was his goal,\" he said, adding the two had not spoken in about five years. After the family moved out, there were occasional renters in the townhouse, said Robert Baggett, president of the Riverpark Homeowners Association. Several years ago, the townhouse went into foreclosure. The family also did not pay their homeowners' association fees for \"at least three or four years,\" he said. \"We don't know what happened,\" Baggett said of the Baleses and their Auburn property, which Sunday had a notice posted on its door that read \"Do Not Occupy.\" CNN's Susan Candiotti, Paul Vercammen, Moni Basu, Ross Levitt and Chelsea J.

      "28. Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- The American soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a shooting rampage is sitting in a military courtroom for the next week or more, hearing the evidence against him. The Article 32 hearing began Monday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state to determine if a trial is warranted for U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who could get the death penalty if convicted. The deadly shooting spree near a small U.S. base in Afghanistan's Kandahar province last March strained already tense U.S.-Afghan relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull out American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. \"He committed a mass killing crime, and we would like the court in the United States to implement justice and punish him according to the crime,\" Ahmad Zia Syamak, a spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, told CNN on Monday. Bales acted with \"chilling premeditation\" and was \"lucid, coherent and responsive\" when he left the remote outpost and went from house to house, gunning down villagers, Lt. Col. Joseph Morse, the Army's prosecutor, told the court. Women and children were among the 16 dead and six wounded, authorities said. \"Nothing really justifies killing women and children in a noncombat situation,\" Bales' attorney, John Henry Browne, told CNN earlier. \"But there may be explanations if that's true.\" Read more: Stunned friends recall good deeds of Afghanistan killings suspect . The first soldier to testify Monday was Cpl. David Godwin, who said he watched a movie and drank Jack Daniels whiskey with Bales and another soldier, Sgt. Jason McLaughlin, just hours before the alleged attack. The soldiers drank moderately and did not get drunk, Godwin said. Godwin was awakened early the next morning and told Bales was missing from camp, he testified. The soldiers searched the camp for Bales, who re-appeared about 4:30 a.m. and was taken into custody, he said. Sgt. McLaughlin testified next, telling the court that Bales had awakened him at 2 a.m. and told him he had been in a nearby village and had \"shot some people up.\" Mclaughlin said he didn't believe Bales and he told him to let him get back to sleep because he had to go on duty in an hour. \"I'll be back at 5,\" he said Bales told him. \"You got me?\" As Bales departed, he told McLaughlin, \"Take care of my kids,\" McLaughlin testified. When Bales approached McLaughlin and Godwin after he was taken into custody he asked them \"Did you rat me out? Did you rat me out, man?\" Godwin testified. Bales, who had blood on his uniform and face, said, \"I thought I was doing the right thing,\" Godwin testified. While waiting for helicopter to take him away, Bales told Godwin \"It's bad. It's bad. It's real bad,\" Godwin said. Capt. Daniel Fields, the third witness, said that when he asked Bales what had happened after he surrendered, he replied, \"I'm sorry I let you down.\" A crowd of Afghan villagers gathered outside the camp as the sun began to rise that morning, Fields said. He was told their trucks were filled with people who had been shot, he said. \"Interpreters were spit on because the people knew they worked for Americans,\" so the U.S. soldiers stayed out of sight to avoid a confrontation, he testified. Browne said in a CBS interview that his client appeared to have memory problems predating the incident. \"He has some memories about what happened before the alleged event and some memories after the alleged event and some windows here and there into things, but he really doesn't have any memory,\" Browne said. Along with the 16 counts of premeditated murder, six counts of attempted murder and seven counts of assault, Bales is also charged with illicit use of alcohol and steroids. The steroid use will be a key factor in Bales' defense, Browne said. \"Steroid use is going to be an issue in this case, especially where Sgt. Bales got steroids and how he got steroids,\" he told CNN last spring. Bales, who served three tours of duty in Iraq before being sent to Afghanistan, may have been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, Browne said. Bales suffered a traumatic brain injury during a roadside bomb explosion and lost part of his foot in separate tours in Iraq, he said. \"Anybody that has seen what he's seen and done what he's done at the request of the military -- and I'm not talking about these allegations -- I think would have PTSD. ... Dragging parts of bodies around is not something you forget very often.\" Read more: Soldier who allegedly killed 16 Afghans engaged in financial fraud . Following Afghan tradition, the 16 victims were buried soon after the deaths, before autopsies could be done. Some legal experts have told CNN that could present a difficulty for prosecutors. But there were photographs taken of the victims and survivors who saw it happen. Also, if any rounds were recovered from the scene and matched his weapon, they could be used as evidence against Bales. The Article 32 hearing, named after the section of the military code of justice that dictates how it works, is sort of a combination of a grand jury hearing and a preliminary hearing in a civilian criminal case. But there are significant differences. For instance, there will be significant testimony from many of the potential witnesses in the case, and unlike in a grand jury case, Bales and his attorney will be there and be able to cross-examine the witnesses against him or even present witnesses of their own. Read more: Afghan villagers describe slaying's horror, differ on number involved . This hearing, which is expected to last up to two weeks, will be even more unusual in that the courtroom will be linked by satellite to Afghanistan, where some of the witnesses will testify by teleconference. On some days, the hearing in Washington state won't even begin until dinnertime, when the day is just beginning on the other side of the world in Afghanistan. In one other difference from civilian court, the person who acts as the judge in the case will not make a decision about whether the case should go to trial in a court-martial. He or she will make a recommendation to the officer who ordered that the hearing be held. That person will decide which, if any, charges Bales will face at trial and also whether prosecutors will pursue the death penalty in the case. Under fire: Wartime stress as a defense for murder .

      "29. (CNN) -- The largest case of bank fraud in Iranian history is threatening to engulf President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after a parliamentary commission decided to investigate his office for possible connections to the crime, Iranian state media has reported. To add insult to injury, Islamist hard-line legislators loyal to Iran's Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, subsequently sent the commission a letter requesting specifically that Ahmadinejad be included in the investigation. They have since said they would not follow up on the letter out of respect for Khamenei. It is one move of many by Islamists to link the president to the alleged embezzlement of 30 trillion Iranian rials -- more than $2.5 billion. To frame the extent of allegations in U.S. terms: It would be akin to religious conservative legislators attempting to implicate a sitting American president in the infamous Madoff Ponzi scheme, in which disgraced financier Bernie Madoff cheated investors out of $50 billion. Ahmadinejad has vehemently rejected accusations that anyone in his government is linked to what is currently the highest-profile crime in the country, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency. \"The government had no role in this affair and the banking system itself discovered the fraud,\" Ahmadinejad said in a televised interview Tuesday, according to Mehr. Two Iranian economists who spoke to CNN alluded to political opportunism in the accusations against the president and people close to him. But both believe politicians were involved, possibly even directly. The size and nature of the fraud required \"a trend inside the government to make this problem and this scandal,\" said Tehran economic analyst Saeed Laylaz. A second economist points out that the main suspect in the case has ties to the Iranian president's chief adviser, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who used his influence in a bank business deal for the accused man, Amir Mansoor Khosravi. Khosravi had opened a private bank known as the Bank Arya. Getting a license is usually difficult, but Mashaei used his political pull to help pave the way, said economist Dr. Behrooz Hady Zonooz from Tehran. \"More than ten times he has written letters to bank persons,\" said Zonooz, who spoke with banking officials about the founding of the bank. A former professor of economics, Zonooz now runs a development consultancy and has closely followed the embezzlement case. He has also spoken to officials close to it and been allowed to see some of the bank data firsthand. Mashaei and Khosravi also both come from the same province, said Zonooz. Mashaei, the president's adviser as well as a close personal friend, is also a thorn in the side of Islamist politicians loyal to Khamenei. Hardliners have long called for Mashaei's dismissal, but Ahmadinejad has held fast to his loyal friend, with whom he now has family ties. In 2008, Mashaei's daughter married Ahmadinejad's eldest son. Mashaei has regularly rankled the religious right with conciliatory tones toward Israel and the United States -- moves considered serious gaffes in Iran -- and his habit of shaking hands with women in formal settings, which is considered culturally impolite by many in Iranian society and thought to be indecent by the religious right. In defense of softer comments toward the United States and Israel, Mashaei has explained to Iranian state TV: \"My statement was that we, the Iranian people, are friends of the whole wide world, even the people of Israel and America. There is no reason for us not to be friends. I did not deny making that statement, and I am not denying it now.\" Bold words for a presidential adviser in Iran. Khamenei has rebutted Mashaei's statements as not reflecting Iran's position. Mashaei's praise for historic heroes of pre-Islamic times, when Zoroastrianism -- now a minority faith -- was the religion of the land, has particularly offended Islamist politicians. Even though the Iranian bank fraud, which made use of illegitimate letters of credit, encompasses a much smaller amount of money than the Madoff Ponzi scheme did, it is at least twice the size when compared to Iran's GDP, according to Zonooz. \"It is about 0.8% of GDP,\" he said. \"If you measure it by the outstanding loans of the banking system to the private sector, it is about 1% of the outstanding loans.\" In other words, 100 such scams \"could take all of the banking system.\" The crime involves at least seven banks, Press TV has reported, including two major financial institutions, Bank Sederat and Bank Melli. \"Bank Melli Iran is the biggest banking system in the Islamic world,\" said Laylaz. \"It is very big and the oldest bank in the country. This bank has suffered a lot.\" Rhetoric linking the embezzlement to the president's office is as old as the scandal itself. A conservative Islamist newspaper, Kayhan, has been widely credited for bringing the fraud to light, when it reported financial misappropriations and other shady dealings in June in an article headlined \"The Weeds.\" The article alleged involvement of people close to Ahmadinejad, whom hardliners have labeled the \"deviant current\" for their departure from the righteous principals of Islam in society, politics and economics -- people associated with Ahmadinejad's friend and adviser Mashaei. \"We hope that the respected president will take out the members of this deviant band like weeds and throw them out of the garden of government,\" the article stated, addressing Ahmadinejad. The \"deviant current\" label has become a well-established political slight in Iranian state media. The criminal investigation of the embezzlement has lead to 22 arrests and the resignation of three of Iran's highest banking officials, according to state-run Press TV. The head of Bank Melli fled the country for Canada in late September, Press TV reported. CNN found his name and address on the Internet in a cached view of an Iranian business contact website in Toronto. The phone numbers and website listed did not work. The embezzlement case was referred to the courts in August, Press TV said. Although they have faced criticism in state media, members of the government had not previously been subjects of the bank fraud investigation. But then in first days of October, a commission charged with investigating illegal activity in the judicial and executive branches -- which would include the office of the president -- called up evidence in the case, according to Press TV, in order to scrutinize it for any involvement in the fraud by members of the government. On October 3, 11 Islamist members of parliament sent a letter to the Article 90 Commission of the Majlis --- Majlis is the name for Iran's parliament -- demanding that Ahmadinejad be included in their investigation, Mehr News Agency reported. The Mehr article pointed out that just enough parliamentarians accused the president or ministers to require that the matter be immediately investigated. A day later, the hardliners announced they would not follow up on their letter, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency, out of respect after Khamenei said that \"an atmosphere of calm is needed in order for this case to be investigated.\" The Mehr article detailed the complicated parliamentary procedure that could lead to the president's impeachment, which includes at least three rounds of voting. The Mehr News Agency is belongs to the hardline Islamic Propagation Organization. On the same day, Mehr published an article in which Khamenei called for the strictest of punishment for those convicted, urging judicial officials to \"cut off the hands of the traitors.\" Corruption is rampant in Iran, and political involvement in it is commonplace, leaving politicians no lack of scandals of which to accuse their opponents, says economist Zonooz. \"Always there has been corruption in the government -- different sectors -- and everybody knows it, but recently, because the rivalry for the next election has increased, they're trying to use these as a tool against their rival groups,\" he said. Transparency International gives Iran the same grade on corruption as Haiti, the Ivory Coast and Libya. The theocratic regime stands near the bottom of TI's rating list -- number 146 out of 178 nations. Pakistan, Nigeria and Zimbabwe come away better. Fighting corruption is a common mantra espoused by Iran's political leaders. But they are failing, according to economist Laylaz, and should be held responsible, although he does not name specific government officials. \"The most important thing for politics, for the government, for the judiciary system is that we create an atmosphere in which corruption cannot occur, cannot appear,\" Laylaz said. \"They brought this atmosphere, and in my opinion, they are responsible for this disaster.\" Although this bank fraud is the largest in the county's history, Laylaz believes that it represents less than a quarter of current such crimes in his country. And it will not harm Iran's economy, he said. \"From an economic point of view, it is not so significant. It will not affect the economy of the country. But from a psychological point of view, it affects very much,\" he explained. Zonooz agreed, and said that the seized assets of those arrested will more than cover the economic damage the embezzlement caused. Most of the embezzled money was used to buy companies from the government, he added, placing it into the country's economy and government coffers. Ahmadinejad's opponents did not conspire to concoct a presidential scandal out of the bank fraud, Zonooz believes. \"There was no plot, but the timing of this discovery and the intentions of the government authorities is meaningful,\" the economist said. Religious ultra-conservative politicians seeking leverage against Ahmadinejad to force him to fall in line with the country's supreme leader now have the opportunity to associate him -- via his liberal friends -- with the worst embezzlement scandal in the country's history.\n",
      "30. (CNN) -- It has been nearly four weeks since Italians went to the polls and the country is still drifting rudderless without a functioning government. This week, political leaders are holding two days of crucial talks with Italy's ceremonial president of the republic, Giorgio Napolitano. The talks began Wednesday morning and are expected to conclude at 6 p.m. Thursday in Rome. Italy's February elections were inconclusive, and have created a political gridlock that is hobbling the country's economy. The nation is currently in its longest recession in 20 years. It's economy -- Europe's third-largest with a government debt the Treasury Ministry puts at $2.6 trillion -- shrank by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, Eurobarometer says. After the elections failed to produce a government, international ratings agency Fitch downgraded Italy's credit rating from A- to BBB+ and warned of further risks if political uncertainty continues and reforms and austerity measures are stalled by a lack of a functioning government. Italy's hung parliament met for the first time on Friday, when ministers began the process of electing leaders of the lower house and the Senate. Laura Boldrini, 51, a former journalist and spokeswoman for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, won a strong majority as the speaker of the lower house. Piero Grasso, 68, an anti-mafia magistrate from Sicily, became the speaker of the Senate. At a news conference Tuesday, Boldrini and Grasso pledged to push through legislation that would cut salaries and benefits for members of parliament by 30%. Italian lawmakers are among the highest paid in all of Europe, according to a Eurobarometer poll in 2011. \"We are asking for the same kinds of sacrifices to our pay that Italians are suffering through the recession,\" Boldrini told CNN by telephone. But Italy is still lacking a functioning prime minister. None of the country's top leading parties currently has enough support to lead the country single-handedly, and none of the leaders have so far showed a willingness to form a grand coalition or support each other's candidates for the prime ministerial role. Napolitano said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that during this week's talks he will first attempt to persuade leaders to support Pierluigi Bersani of the center-left Partito Democratico as prime minister. Bersani fared the best in the February elections by leading a leftist coalition to a small majority in the lower house of parliament. But he was unable to win a majority in the Senate, where it counts. Instead, power in the Senate was divided between Bersani and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center-right coalition, anchored by his party, Popolo della Liberta, or People of Freedom. Bersani and Berlusconi are arch-rivals who have indicated they will not work together. Bersani's platform included judicial reforms that reverse legislation passed when Berlusconi held office, including expanding statutes of limitations on financial crimes and stripping political leaders of immunity. Berlusconi is currently awaiting a verdict in a trial in which he stands accused of paying an underage prostitute for sex on more than 13 occasions and abusing his office to protect her in an unrelated crime. The verdict is expected to come in early April. Last year, Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud. Last month, he was convicted of publishing illegally acquired wiretaps in his brother's newspaper. He is appealing both convictions. Berlusconi has indicated that he does not agree with Bersani's judicial and criminal reforms and that he would not work with the center-left as long as those items are on the agenda. The election deadlock has meant that Beppe Grillo, a former comedian and political revolutionary who led his grass-roots Five-Star Movement to third-place in the elections by promising to get rid of Italy's tired politicians and traditional political parties, would be the key to power if he were to support one of the traditional parties. But since the elections, he has refused to work with either Bersani or Berlusconi, resulting in the political gridlock. He has said no to a political or technocratic government, leaving little room to negotiate. Grillo, continuing to rebuff Bersani's attempts to work together to form a coalition, Friday called Bersani \"dead man talking.\" But his own party is showing some fractures. A dozen of its members in parliament voted against the party's candidates in the elections last weekend to choose the parliamentary leaders. Grillo, who is not a member of parliament and did not run for office, lambasted his unfaithful party members on his personal blog. Mario Monti, who led Italy in a technocratic role after Berlusconi resigned under pressure in November 2011, did not win enough support in the February elections to bolster either side, and his austerity platform is not seen as a draw for support. He has been acting as prime minister since the election produced no winner, but he threatened to walk off the job last weekend during the debate over electing the parliamentary leaders. Saturday, Napolitano asked Monti to stay on in his caretaker role until a government can be formed. \"It is important for Europe, and to exercise whatever initiatives are possible and necessary, especially for the economy and jobs, the government remains under the authoritative leadership of Mario Monti until a new government is formed,\" Napolitano said in a written statement. Napolitano's intervention meetings on Wednesday and Thursday will either confirm Bersani as a prime minister or produce a technocratic leader who will guide the country forward to inevitable early elections, likely either in June or next autumn. To further complicate matters, Napolitano's mandate as president ends on May 15. In accordance with Italy's electoral law, the president cannot dissolve parliament or call new elections with less than six months left in office. That means that either with or without a prime minister, Italy's hung parliament must begin the process of electing a new president to replace Napolitano. That process will start on April 15 with the nomination of candidates, a step subject to a fair amount of backroom horse-trading. Berlusconi recently said in an interview on his Mediaset television network that he would consider agreeing to Bersani as prime minister if his center-right ally, Gianni Letta, were elected president of the Republic. Other presidential candidate names mentioned by members of parliament in interviews with the Italian press include Monti and respected Radical Party leader and former European Union Member of Parliament Emma Bonino.\n",
      "31. Johannesburg (CNN) -- When Nelson Mandela was admitted to hospital, South Africans took a deep breath and prepared themselves for the worst. Despite the government issuing statements telling concerned citizens not to panic, they did. Mandela holds such a special place in South African's hearts that they fortify themselves with the inevitable day when he takes his last breath. At 93, many here are grateful the former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner is still with them. He has long left the public and political stage but the knowledge that he is still around -- enjoying retirement on a farm in the Eastern Cape -- gives them a sense of comfort. Nelson Mandela is held in deep affection because he reminds South Africans of how far they have come. Mandela rekindles South Africans nostalgia for a time when this country was a miracle of democracy. Mandela is the embodiment of the South Africa that was promised in the election of 1994. The reality is that many South Africans worry that their \"rainbow nation\" no longer embodies Mandela's vision. With Mandela old and silent, there have been many worrying signs that his country has deviated off Mandela's path of reconciliation and democracy, say observers. The government, under President Jacob Zuma, finds it challenging to embrace Mandela's dedication to a critical and probing free press. A new law, called the Protection of Information Bill, could jail journalists and whistleblowers for up to 25 years if they are caught in possession of classified state information. The government has refused to add a \"public interest\" clause, which would limit the scope of this legislation. The government says this law aims to protect the country from foreign enemies. However, civil society groups say it is an attempt to muzzle the press, which has been vigorous in reporting corruption within government. Corruption has for many, become the cancer at the heart of modern-day South Africa. It seems not a day goes by without a civil servant being outed for dodgy dealings. The former police chief is in prison for accepting bribes from a crime boss, the wife of the minister of state security has been found guilty of drug trafficking and Schabir Schaik, President Zuma's former financial adviser, who was jailed for fraud and corruption, barely served his sentence and is on \"medical parole\" despite being seen playing golf by journalists. The province of Limpopo was recently declared \"technically bankrupt\" by the national treasury after discovering there was \"unauthorized and irregular\" spending by the provincial leadership. Observers say the looting of state coffers is not just limited to the Limpopo province. Additionally, the cornerstone of Mandela's legacy -- the constitution -- has always been a soothing balm to even the most pessimistic about South Africa's prospects. No matter the challenges that convulse society, there was always the sense that the work of the judiciary and the Constitutional Court would protect the democratic edifice. When President Zuma recently said in a newspaper interview that he was looking to \"review\" the work of the Constitutional Court there was a deep sense of dismay. Many people have been left wondering why ANC-led government would tinker with the foundations of Mandela's South Africa. Mandela is said by those close to him to be suffering from a form of senile dementia, which doctors say is common in the very old. He gets confused and is easily upset and agitated. Importantly, for a man who was obsessed with the news, his family and the military now largely protect him from the details of everyday life. If he really understood what was going on around him, what would Nelson Mandela say about an apartheid-era law that was being used to threaten journalists trying to report on his health? Ironically, the government is using the National Key Points and Strategic Installations Bill -- previously known as the feared National Key Points Act -- to increase the powers of the security structures to declare, in secret, buildings that are of \"national importance.\" This law was created in 1980 at the height of the state of emergency and policed by apartheid forces. When reporters stood on the perimeter of the military hospital believed to be where Mandela was being treated, they were threatened with arrest if they filmed the hospital building. One photographer was detained briefly and has since been released. The same law has been evoked in a case against two news agencies, which apparently set up cameras outside Mandela's Eastern Cape home. Legal experts hope that case goes to court because they say this \"key points\" legislation would never pass a constitutional test. Despite many contradictions, South Africa remains a beautiful and extraordinary nation. Present day South Africa is so much better than those dark, ugly days when Nelson Mandela was in jail and the racist laws subjugated most citizens. However, the reason South Africans panic when they hear Mandela is unwell is because they think to their future. They worry that when the day finally comes that Mandela goes, the country loses its democratic anchor.\n",
      "32. (Mental Floss) -- Investigators are trying to figure out whether the financial fraud allegedly perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff was, in fact, the largest Ponzi scheme in history. The alleged scam, which cost investors $50 billion, sounds like a classic Ponzi racket. The New York home of Bernard Madoff, who's accused in a $50 billion Ponzi scheme. But what is a Ponzi scheme? And why does it bear this name? First, you need to know a little bit about its namesake, Charles Ponzi. Anyone can work a simple swindle, but you have to be a special kind of con man to have your name become synonymous with \"fraud.\" Ponzi pulled it off, though. After arriving in the U.S. from Italy in 1903, Ponzi knocked around in a variety of unskilled jobs that usually ended when he got into trouble for theft or cheating customers. A few years later, he moved to Canada, where he spent a hitch in prison for passing a forged check. When he eventually drifted back down to the U.S., he needed a way to make some quick cash.  Watch how a Ponzi scheme works » . Making money via mail . Ponzi eventually found his way to get rich quick using a vagary of the postal system. At the time, it was common for letters abroad to include an international reply coupon -- a voucher that could be exchanged for minimum postage back to the country from which the letter was sent. Thus, if you sent your buddy in France a letter, you could include a coupon so he could respond. (This practice still exists but is less common.) As exchange and postal rates fluctuated, though, there was an opportunity to make a profit. You only had to purchase postal reply coupons cheaply in some foreign country, send them back to the U.S. to swap them out for American stamps of a higher value, then sell these stamps. This arrangement was perfectly legal; it was just cleverly gaming the system. Ponzi started buying and selling postal reply coupons using agents in his native Italy, and he was making a good living doing it. Unfortunately, whatever defect made Ponzi steal from his employers and pass bad checks prompted him to get greedy here, too. He started to recruit investors into his system with the promise of 50 percent returns in just a few days. Investors would pay their cash in, and sure enough, Ponzi would get them the promised return. Everyone was happy with the results, and word started to spread about this Italian financial wizard. Within two years, he had employees all over the country recruiting new takers for this foolproof investment strategy. Ponzi was pocketing millions, and he enjoyed a sumptuous life outside of Boston. At his peak, Ponzi was raking in $250,000 a day, which enabled him to collect such necessities as gold-handled canes. He became a celebrity investor, almost like the Warren Buffett of his day. The scheme . Why is it hard to think of Ponzi's name without affixing \"scheme\" to the end of it, then? Ponzi's underlying \"business\" -- the arbitrage on the postal coupons -- wasn't actually as sound as he claimed. In fact, there wasn't even really a business. However, since so much money was flowing in from new investors, he could just pay off the returns for the old ones from the new cash. In fact, Ponzi didn't even need to pay off the old investors, since many of them wanted to reinvest their returns in this wonderful business. Ponzi's charms made it easy for him to placate any worried customers, and his con looked unstoppable. Mental Floss: 4 very big paychecks for very little work . Fuzzy math . Eventually, though, smarter financial heads started looking at Ponzi's business. Clarence Barron, owner of the Wall Street Journal and founder of the financial magazine that bears his name, realized Ponzi must have been a huckster and went on the offensive. While Barron conceded that there probably was a way for a person to make a small amount of quick cash on the postal reply coupon scheme, he figured that Ponzi would have to be moving 160 million coupons around to raise the cash he needed to support the business. Since there were only 27,000 postal reply coupons circulating in the world, Ponzi's story didn't check out. (Things only got worse when the Postal Service reported that there wasn't a huge flow of the coupons from one country to the other.) On top of that, Barron noted that Ponzi told newspapers he invested his own cash in real estate, stocks, and bonds like any normal investor. Barron pointed out the obvious question here: if Ponzi had this failsafe scheme in which he could make a 50 percent profit, why was he putting his own money into plain old investment instruments that would give him (maybe) a 5 percent return? Those certainly didn't sound like the actions of a financial genius. Barron's conclusions ran as front-page news in the Boston Post in July 1920, which would have been damning for most cons. Ponzi was such a charismatic force of nature, though, that many people chose not to believe the paper's report. Few believed that their hero, the man who had \"tripled\" their life savings, was anything less than 100 percent legitimate. In fact, the morning that the Post ran Barron's report, investors lined up around the block outside of his office in an attempt to give him more money -- even after they'd been told that they'd been scammed. Ponzi later boasted that he'd taken in a million dollars in new investments the day the report ran. Mental Floss: 5 of history's worst perpetrators of corruption . The unraveling . Things were starting to look less rosy for the scammer, though. Although he'd largely placated his investors after Barron's report, Ponzi must have realized his window of opportunity was closing. He hired a publicist, William McMasters, but the PR man saw through Ponzi's lies and renounced his client in the press. James Walsh reprints part of McMasters' slam of Ponzi in his book, \"You Can't Cheat An Honest Man.\" Of Ponzi, McMasters said, \"The man is a financial idiot. He can hardly add...He sits with his feet on the desk smoking expensive cigars in a diamond holder and talking complete gibberish about postal coupons.\" The next month, regulators raided Ponzi's office and discovered that he didn't have a huge quantity of postal reply coupons. Since Ponzi had used the mail to notify his marks of how their \"investments\" were performing, he faced serious mail fraud charges; in total, the government brought 86 charges against him in two separate indictments. Ponzi pled guilty to one of these charges in exchange for a light sentence of five years. He served around three and a half years, then got his release to face state charges, for which he received a sentence of nine more years. But before he could go back to jail, he jumped bail and tried to start new scams in Florida and Texas. (You'd think the government would have learned their lesson about trusting this guy.) Eventually, though, his time on the lam ran out, and he served his whole sentence. Upon his release, Ponzi was deported to Italy and spent the rest of his life in poverty before dying in 1949 in Rio de Janeiro, where he's buried in a pauper's grave.

      "33. Editor's note: Thomas Levenson is a professor at MIT, where he heads the Graduate Program in Science Writing. He is the author of a new book, \"Newton and the Counterfeiter\" and an award-winning filmmaker, with 10 documentaries on science broadcast on PBS. Thomas Levenson says Isaac Newton's bad gamble shows financial regulation has always been needed. (CNN) -- From winter to spring 1720, London, England, was delirious, entranced, rolling in money. It seemed as if riches were so easily gained that only fools would not buy into that brand new engine of wealth, the stock exchange, and especially into shares of the enterprise leading the boom, a banking concern called the South Sea Company. As spring turned into summer, no one, it seemed, could deny the obvious, not even the most rational of men. So, in June and again in July, Sir Isaac Newton -- the inventor of calculus (the branch of mathematics that describes change over time, which is to say, an awful lot of what matters in both science and life); the man who framed the laws of motion and set physics on its modern trajectory; a pioneering chemist, an inventor (virtually all present-day telescopes derive from his design), a religious historian -- and even a financial thinker -- put a sizable chunk of his personal fortune into shares of the South Sea Company. The bubble burst that September. Newton lost 90 percent of his stake -- a substantial fraction of his total worth. In that loss can be found the key to the debate we are having right now in the wake of the Obama administration's move to re-regulate American financial markets. Arguments over the supervision of financial transactions occur in the wake of every bubble. Opponents of such regulation always return to the same simple claim. They say that investors are grown-ups, capable of making the best assessments of their own interests and acting accordingly. Markets are thus no more than self-correcting mechanisms for connecting such rational actors, and any attempt to impose rules on their interaction will only render them less efficient. Those in favor say that all this is nonsense, that in the real world, markets are not populated by equally well-informed people analyzing their own circumstances and acting accordingly -- and that every financial collapse thus takes down both those who should have known better and those who couldn't have hoped to. Hence, they say, an active enforcer needs to provide a level playing field and to deter actual fraud. Painfully recent experience suggests that's true enough -- but Newton's case suggests a deeper necessity at the heart of the case for proactive regulation. What happened to him, or rather, how he acted, reveals a fundamental truth of economic and emotional life: At the point of crisis, when clear thought and a cool head matter most, no one is in fact a rational actor -- not even the greatest scientific mind of his or any other age. So what brought Newton low? Desire, perhaps envy, or, in other words, human nature. Newton had been an active trader in the new stock market for years before the bubble year of 1720. He made his first investment in the South Sea issue early, in 1713, and held it for several years, marking a modest paper profit. He held on through early 1720, as the company pursued a new and increasingly risky banking deal -- and as insiders began to talk up the (as it turned out, fictitious) trading profits the company expected from another venture. That got the desired result, a sudden leap in stock prices. Starting at £128 in January, the price for South Sea securities rose to £175 in February and then £330 in March. Newton kept his head -- at first. He sold in April, content with his (quite spectacular) gains to date. But then, between April and June, share prices tripled, reaching over £1,000 ... which is precisely when he could stand it no longer. Having \"lost\" two thirds of his potential gain, Newton bought again at the very top, and bought more after a slight decline in July. If that sounds familiar, it should, at least to buyers of Webvan in 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst -- or, for that matter, to those who picked up Lehman Brothers shares in winter 2008. The South Sea stock price held up through August 1720, and then in September, the gap between the possible income from all the purchased debt and the returns promised to investors became too obvious to ignore. The bubble burst, and South Sea share prices collapsed to roughly their pre-bubble level. Newton's losses totaled as much as £20,000, between $4 million and $5 million in 21st century terms. The catastrophe did not sink him; he had made other, more cautious investments, including a significant stake in the East India Company, and when he died in 1727, his estate was valued at £30,000 pounds. But it was a terrific blow, even so. Here's why this story matters now. Of all people, Newton should have known better. He had, after all, invented the mathematics that could expose the impossibility of the South Sea Company's promise of returns to be paid to an everlasting stream of new investors. And yet, even he could not resist the prospect of infinite returns on his money. Hence, the obligation to regulate. There is plenty of recent academic research that confirms that bubbles -- including the ones we've just endured -- are not unique disasters, but the predictable consequences of human behavior in the context of implausible rewards. What Newton's experience tells us is that this has been true since the beginning of modern markets -- and that mere intelligence, even genius, doesn't help. Isaac Newton said so himself. After the disaster, he could not bear to hear the phrase \"South Sea\" mentioned in his presence. But just once he admitted that while he knew how to predict the motions of the cosmos, \"he could not calculate the madness of the people.\" We still can't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Levenson.\n",
      "34. (CNN) -- A rogue trader has cost UBS an estimated $2 billion, the Swiss banking giant announced Thursday, revealing what could be the third-largest loss of its kind in banking history. A $2 billion rogue trading loss would be all but unprecedented, market analyst Ralph Silva told CNN. \"We have only had three or four other situations... in the billions, and that is exactly what happened,\" he said. The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said. Shares in UBS were down 11% on the U.S. stock exchange at midday trading, though, even as European markets closed higher Thursday. Police arrested a man on suspicion of fraud in an early-morning operation in London's banking district hours before the loss was announced, they said. UBS contacted the police at 1 a.m. about an allegation of fraud, and a 31-year-old man was arrested at work two and a half hours later, police commander Ian Dyson said. British media named the suspect as UBS trader Kweku Adoboli, 31. CNN has not independently confirmed his identity, but was told when calling his desk at UBS that he was not available. The bank declined to comment on the arrest. News of the rogue trader comes amid pronounced economic anxiety in Europe. Markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that Greece might default on its huge debt, sending shock waves through the 17-nation eurozone and further afield. Just this week, the credit rating agency Moody's downgraded two French banks. On Thursday -- even as news was circulating of the incident at UBS -- came word that the Federal Reserve and four other powerful central banks announced they were throwing a lifeline to Europe's struggling banks. The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt. European banks have seen U.S. dollars flow out as U.S. financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to European banks, amid fears over those institutions' exposure to debt held by Greece and other European nations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is to attend a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed. Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies will also be present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month. As to the episode at UBS, Silva, the analyst, outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place: intentional fraud, \"basic stupidity\" in trading strategy, or what the banking industry calls \"fat fingers,\" which means typing the wrong number by accident. Perhaps the trader \"put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem,\" Silva said. Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job. \"Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year,\" said van Dam. \"With the volatility in banking stocks, commodities and currencies, things can go wrong really, really easily. If you're worried about your job and you try to hide (a mistake or loss), you can see how these situations arise.\" A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said. \"He must have done something that he wasn't supposed to do, obviously,\" van Dam said. UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated. But the \"unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank\" could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said. The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading. Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year. Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the global copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997. Nick Leeson, the subject of the Ewan McGregor movie \"Rogue Trader,\" lost about $1.3 billion for his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close. UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said. There is a \"much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up\" into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients' exposure to investment banking losses, he said. He favors that alternative, he said. \"The banks are too large,\" van Dam said. \"The products are so complicated, and the management doesn't understand it.\" UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that.

      "35. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Elie Wiesel, the Nazi concentration camp survivor who went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize, showed little inclination this week to make peace with accused swindler Bernie Madoff, whom he called \"one of the greatest scoundrels, thieves, liars, criminals.\" Elie Wiesel called on the federal government to bail out charities just as it has bailed out carmakers and banks. \"Could I forgive him? No,\" the 80-year-old told a panel assembled Thursday by Conde Nast's Portfolio Magazine at New York's 21 Club to discuss Madoff, whose alleged victims included Wiesel and his foundation, The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. \"To forgive, first of all, would mean that he would come on his knees and ask for forgiveness,\" the Auschwitz survivor said. \"He wouldn't do that.\" Madoff, 70, is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that may have cost investors up to $50 billion. He faces one charge of securities fraud in connection with an international scheme that has cost some investors their life savings and could land him in prison for up to 20 years. Wiesel said a wealthy friend who has known Madoff for 50 years introduced them. The two men met twice over dinner, and Wiesel checked with financial experts whom he trusted before investing all of his and his wife's personal money. Then, once Madoff had gained his trust, Wiesel invested all $15.2 million that his foundation had amassed, he said. \"We thought he was God, we trusted everything in his hands,\" the Boston University humanities professor said. Wiesel put his friend's loss at $50 million. Wiesel rejected the suggestion that \"affinity fraud,\" the tendency for people to trust others of similar background, played any role in leaving him vulnerable to Madoff. Both men are Jewish. \"It's not the Jewishness in him, it's the inhumanity in this man who simply believed he can go around depriving people of their livelihoods. What he has done to certain people, it breaks my heart,\" he said. \"At the end, he went down to swindle thousands and thousands of people, and hurt thousands and thousands of people. Take our little foundation. My wife takes care of 1,000 Ethiopian children in Israel. What he does to them -- we were going to open a third center in Jerusalem. We cannot do it now. What [he has] done to others, to hospitals, to educational institutions, my God! Didn't he think?\" Wiesel said he is planning legal action against Madoff but called for the federal government to bail out charities just as it has bailed out carmakers and banks. \"I think it would be a great gesture that the Obama administration should show, we really think of those who are helpless and who are doing with their money only good things.\" Wiesel offered a punishment he would like to see meted out to the financier, who is under house arrest but has not been indicted. \"I would like him to be in a solitary cell with a screen, and on that screen, for at least five years of his life, every day and every night there should be pictures of his victims, one after the other after the other, always saying, 'Look, look what you have done to this poor lady, look what you have done to this child, look what you have done.' \"But nothing else -- he should not be able to avoid those faces, for years to come. This is only a minimum punishment.\" Madoff's attorney, Ira Sorkin, said he understands Wiesel's point of view, but said Madoff must be presumed innocent. Sorkin said the financial debacle is a tragedy, but added that his client is doing everything he can to help the government recover the funds. Despite what he called his family's \"personal tragedy,\" Wiesel said he is organizing a benefit concert for his foundation and has been overwhelmed by unsolicited donations. \"It shows, again, a human being is capable of both very great, good things, and very horrible things,\" he said.\n",
      "36. NEW YORK (CNN) -- In the midst of Wall Street's agonizing slide last week, there was at least one place in Manhattan where the liquor was flowing, the cigar smoke was billowing and the theme of the evening was simple: Work hard. Play hard. \"I was a crook,\" says Jordan Belfort, once a Wall Street fat cat who made $1 million a week before going to jail. \"It's like fiddling. Nero fiddled while Rome burned,\" said Thomas Graf, vice president and producer of Northmarq Capital. \"We're smoking cigars while we're losing our shirts, literally.\" He was among hundreds of mid-level Wall Street executives and traders gathered for a party thrown by Cigar Report magazine, published by New York-based Doubledown Media. And if they seemed a little tone-deaf about how this kind of event could be perceived as millions of dollars were lost, at least on paper, most did not seem especially concerned. \"It is a great time,\" said Adam Marsh of Empire Capital Partners. \"I think for at least a couple of hours in the evening, we can kind of sit back, have a few drinks, forget what's facing us on the Street tomorrow.\" Few of the men and women at the party earned millions in Wall Street bonuses on top of their salaries. But nearly all did very well, they say, at the top of the Wall Street bubble. And their bosses, along with those who managed Wall Street hedge funds, did even better. \"These guys were spending more than $250 billion a year,\" Robert Frank said. \"They bought mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach. They bought art for $100 million a painting.\" Frank, author of \"Richistan,\" says the enormous amounts of money earned by Wall Street elite made them practically a nation unto themselves. \"They just looked at the guy with the bigger house, the nicer Ferrari, the better artwork,\" he said. \"And it was all competitive spending.\" One prominent example is the CEO of Lehman Brothers, Richard Fuld. In 2007 alone, according to the executive compensation firm Equilar, he earned total take-home compensation of more than $45 million in salary and bonuses. Congressional researchers said he earned nearly $500 million from 2000 through 2007. Fuld told Congress that the failure of his company centered on inaction on the part of government and a loss of confidence in the financial markets. \"This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life, regardless of what comes out of this committee, regardless of when the record books get written,\" Fuld told Congress during a recent hearing. Not every Wall Street executive played by the books. Jordan Belfort was once chairman of a brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont. In the early to mid-'90s, he called himself the Wolf of Wall Street. He was jailed on federal charges of securities fraud and money laundering. He spent 22 months behind bars and was released in 2005. \"I was a crook,\" Belfort said. At one time, he says, he was earning more than $1 million a week. Now, he has been ordered to pay back $110 million to his victims, and he said he is working on that. Even the man who first chronicled Wall Street excess to a national audience can barely believe what has happened. Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the film \"Wall Street\" 21 years ago, says the main character in his story, unprincipled stockbroker Gordon Gekko, has been overtaken by reality. \"I never thought it would go to this level,\" Stone told CNN's Larry King. \"I thought the Gordon Gekkos of the world would die out. But they got worse.\" So what exactly did the new Gordon Gekkos do to earn those fabulous sums? \"What they really did was to figure out new and clever ways of investing,\" Frank said. \"Of creating financial products that very few of us could understand.\" \"On Wall Street, there's no cost. The only cost is the employees, the executives,\" said Andy Serwer, managing editor of Fortune magazine. \"So if a firm is creating a financial product that it can sell for $5 million, the person who sells it will get $2 million.\" But people who earned relatively little on Wall Street are now paying the price as well. Win Hornig, a 25-year-old Minnesotan who worked at both Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan, is now out of a job. He's launched a Web site called BankerGoneBroke.com to talk about it. \"My life was basically a disaster,\" Hornig said. \"I was working all the time, didn't have a lot to show for it. I came to the conclusion that there was more to life than money.\" While it lasted, the good times on Wall Street made money for traders and, of course, for Americans who had invested in the stock market, mainly through their 401(k) contributions. But there is a \"new normal\" these days. \"The party is over on Wall Street -- until it comes back again,\" Serwer said. \"I've been around long enough to see that we have these cycles. These guys get their cigars and champagne. They have a great time. The whole thing blows up. But then they re-emerge years later. This one is a really, really bad one. But I don't think Wall Street is dead.\"\n",
      "37. Wisbech (CNN) -- Chatting casually over a pot of tea in the sleepy village of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, Nick Leeson remarks on his time spent in a maximum security prison in Germany in 1995: \"That was the one time I contemplated suicide.\" Thrown in with Yugoslav gunrunners, Bolivian drug lords and sex offenders, \"I wouldn't have been able to do it myself though,\" Leeson added, stirring in the milk. \"But there were these two Italian boys. One of them was an ice cream vendor, Luigi, and another well-dressed man, Salvatore. They were connected.\" Leeson began sipping his tea, and suddenly laughed at how his story sounded like an episode from Italian mafia drama The Sopranos. Leeson, once considered the whiz kid of the Asian derivative markets before his bad trades on Japanese stocks collapsed UK merchant bank Barings, was thinking of doing a final deal: One with his own life. \"It would have cost me Â£10,000 ($15,268) I think,\" he said, struggling to remember, as if the detail is minor. \"I presumed it would happen in the showers one day, someone would just knife me.\" From Watford to a Singapore prison . As the Watford-born Leeson sat regaling the most definitive time of his life, the anthem from Les Miserables \"I dreamed a dream,\" played on loop at the Rose & Crown Hotel, which is owned by his uncle-in-law. Leeson was due to give a speech for charity in the hotel that evening. It provided an eerily fitting soundtrack to his tale. The lyrics \"I was young and unafraid, and dreams were made and used and wasted\" resonate with Leeson's life. He went from high-flying trader to convicted fraudster, spending three and a half years in a gang-ridden Singapore prison. He has now joined GDP Partnership, an Irish restructuring firm. At the Rose & Crown, the couple on the next table appear unaware they are seated next to one of the 20th century's most infamous financial convicts. They're chatting about the hotel's renovations while Leeson is calculating the cost of his trades. \"The press were saying I could spend up to 84 years in prison,\" he said, offering me sugar. \"You don't have to be an MIT mathematician to work out I was gonna be dead.\" \"I spoke to my wife and father about it [suicide],\" he said, explaining that they would have to negotiate the assisted suicide on his behalf from outside prison. \"Obviously they cried but you have to deal with the reality of situation.\" Surviving jail, divorce and cancer . Almost 20 years on and having weathered incarceration, divorce and colon cancer, the man dubbed the \"original rogue trader\" now makes his money on the after-dinner speaking circuit; a far cry from his lucrative days earning $76,000 a year with bonuses of up to $228,000 as a trader speculating on Asian financial markets. When asked if he would press a magic button to take it all back, Leeson told CNN: \"There is no such button.\" Describing himself as a \"realist,\" it may be hard to understand how he could have lost $1.3 billion, destroying a 233-year-old bank in the process. It's even harder to understand why he thought he could hide it away in a secret account known as the \"five eights.\" Public perception of him as a symbol of capitalist greed may precede him, but Leeson doesn't shirk the responsibility. \"Nobody other than me should be accountable for what went wrong at Barings,\" he said. Leeson has no sympathy for rogue traders Jerome Kerviel of Societe Generale and Kweku Adoboli of UBS, who lost $6.4 billion and $1.8 billion respectively. \"Anything that they've done and hidden is fraud.\" Leeson said abruptly. \"I think it's a macho culture that's evolved. When things go wrong, there's a certain age group that is usually involved; young men.\" After leaving his desk and fleeing with his wife to Kuala Lumpur, Leeson resurfaced days later and was arrested in Frankfurt at the age of 28. Imprisoned and awaiting deportation to Singapore, Leeson started to reflect and accept responsibility for his actions. \"Prison was tough,\" said Leeson, who now found himself mixing with dangerous criminals from the Chinese and Malaysian underworld. \"I was the only white guy in there.\" He rattled off details of a typical day of incarceration: \"You're locked up in a cell for 23 hours a day with two other people. You wake up at 6am in the morning and it's a hundred degrees outside. You get three books a month. So there's not much to occupy your mind.\" Leeson could still recall the sores on his pelvis, ankles and elbows that he developed from sleeping on the floor. At the time, Leeson said he received messages of support to keep him sane, including nude photographs from air hostesses. \"I never got the naked pictures, I just got the letter,\" he joked. \"The Singaporean authorities took the good bit away.\" Leeson paused for a moment, before recalling the darkest days of his incarceration. After a strip search and contraband swipe of his cell, he refused an order to return to a cell with two inmates he feared would fight. Leeson was punished, put in solitary confinement for 31 days. \"They would turn the lights on at night and turn them off in the day. There were no windows and there was a hole that they put your food through.\" \"I used to walk up and down 780 times in the cell and that was an hour. That's how I passed time. You start singing to yourself.\" Leeson chuckled. That was hard, because he didn't know the words to many songs. After his release from solitary confinement, Leeson was diagnosed with colon cancer. \"I had an emergency operation to remove a tumor in my stomach that was 9cm by 5cm. It was big.\" Peering over my notebook, he pointed and added quickly as if to make sure I got the all the detail: \"Oh, and I had six months of chemotherapy in prison.\" Leeson was released in 1999, aged 32. Broke, and with no job prospects, he returned to the UK, where he continued cancer treatment. Leeson overcame his illness, and set about rebuilding his life. He sold his story for a six-figure sum to the Daily Mail, wrote a book and had a film made about his time at Barings called \"Rogue Trader\" starring Ewan McGregor. But \"I've never seen a penny of it,\" he said. Barings' liquidators had served Leeson with an injunction of Â£100 million and took 50% of proceeds from his story. \"I asked them 'if I got a job flipping burgers, how much would you want?' and they told me \"half.'\" A quiet life in Ireland . Now 46, Leeson lives the quiet life in Galway, Ireland, and it's difficult to see from his retiring demeanor how he could have destroyed one of the world's most prestigious institutions. Leeson is philosophical about his past these days: \"I created a success story that everyone at the bank wanted to believe.\" He laughed at how absurd that sounds now. Asked if a rogue trader will ever bring down a bank again, Leeson confidently replied: \"No doubt about it. If you ask anyone in the banking industry, they will say 'yes, but it won't be me.'\"\n",
      "38. (CNN) -- Mohamed Morsi is an American-educated engineer who vows to stand for democracy, women's rights, and peaceful relations with Israel if he wins the Egyptian presidency. He's also an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders \"vampires\" and \"killers.\" One analyst describes him as an \"icon\" of those seeking an \"extreme agenda.\" As Morsi, 60, battles to win the presidency, questions surround how much of a hard line he would take, and what direction he would steer the country. Morsi leads the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood -- the most powerful political movement in the new Egyptian government, controlling about half of parliament. His party notes that he was arrested several times under President Hosni Mubarak's regime for protesting \"repressive measures and oppressive practices,\" as well as \"rigged elections.\" At one point he spent seven months in jail. Analysts say Morsi is focusing his campaign on appealing to the broadest possible audience. But he \"represents the older, more conservative wing of the Brotherhood and openly endorses a strict Islamic vision,\" Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in a column for CNN.com. \"A vote for Mohamed Morsi will consolidate the Brotherhood's political influence, which could translate into a constitution with weaker provisions for protection of minority and women's rights.\" A slogan associated with his campaign, \"Islam is the solution,\" is sparking concerns Morsi could introduce a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy. He told CNN he has no such plans. His party seeks \"an executive branch that represents the people's true will and implements their public interests,\" Morsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \"There is no such thing called an Islamic democracy. There is democracy only. ... The people are the source of authority,\" he said. Asked about the role of women, he vowed that \"women's rights are equal to men.\" And asked whether he would maintain Egypt's 1979 accord with Israel, Morsi answered, \"Yes, of course I will. I will respect it provided the other side keep it up and respect it.\" Morsi was not originally his party's candidate for the country's top post. He was called on to step in after the first choice was disqualified. Khairat al-Shater was among three candidates who were told they did not meet candidacy requirements. The Egyptian media then portrayed Morsi as \"an accident of history,\" said Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Dohan Center and the Brookings Institution. In a column published by The Atlantic, Hamid said Morsi lacks the charisma and \"crossover appeal\" of al-Shater. The Financial Times notes that the Muslim Brotherhood had originally pledged not to seek the presidency. \"It went back on its word, suspecting that its gains since the January 2011 revolution could be undermined by the military council that has ruled since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak.\" Morsi has served as a central behind-the-scenes player for much of the past decade, Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy writes in a column for The New Republic. He was the Brotherhood's primary point man for state security -- \"the repressive domestic security apparatus through which the Mubarak regime monitored and infiltrated opposition groups,\" Trager writes. \"Indeed, Brotherhood leaders trusted Morsi because they viewed him as ideologically rigid, and therefore unlikely to concede too much to the regime during negotiations.\" Morsi was also \"an icon of the extremists in the Muslim Brotherhood,\" pushing for an \"extreme agenda,\" Trager writes. Morsi's official biography on the Freedom and Justice Party website describes him as \"one of the most prominent political leadership figures of the Brotherhood, the organization that led the struggle against the ousted repressive regime in its last decade.\" He led the Brotherhood's parliamentary bloc from 2000 to 2005 in addition to serving as president of the Department of Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering at Zagazig University. Morsi was arrested several times \"due to his constantly firm stance against the repressive measures and oppressive practices of the overthrown regime,\" the party said. \"After the 2005 elections were rigged, Dr. Mohamed Morsi led demonstrations in support for judges demanding independence, refusing referral of some judges to the Competence Commission to punish them for their outspoken views against blatant elections fraud.\" The following May, he was among 500 members of the Brotherhood arrested, the party said. Morsi spent seven months behind bars. \"He was arrested, yet again, on the morning of the 'Friday of Anger' on January 28, 2011, during the revolution of January 25 along with a large number of Brotherhood leaders across Egypt. ... When several prisons were destroyed during the revolution, and many prisoners escaped, Dr. Morsi refused to leave his prison cell. Instead, he contacted satellite TV channels and news agencies demanding the judicial authorities visit the prison and check the legal position of jailed Muslim Brotherhood leaders, to clarify if there were indeed any legal reasons for their arrest,\" the party website says. Morsi -- who has Bachelor and Master degrees from Cairo University and a doctorate from the University of Southern California -- insists that under his leadership, such abuses won't happen. There will be \"no need for worry at all over any kind of abusive power,\" he told CNN. \"It will be impossible to allow these kinds of abuse in the shadow of a constitutional state, a lawful state, a state that protects the dignity of a person.\"\n",
      "39. Washington (CNN) -- Republican Rep. Vern Buchanan, a self-made Florida millionaire, is only in his third term in Congress, but he already is in charge of fundraising for the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, and he sits on the powerful House Ways and Means committee. But all that could be jeopardized. Federal investigations underway could result in Buchanan serving his next term behind bars. CNN has confirmed there are no fewer than four congressional and federal investigations into Buchanan's business practices, his campaign finances and his alleged attempt to try to stop a witness from talking. Congress: Same hours, half the work . Now that witness is stepping forward in an exclusive interview with CNN. Buchanan's former business partner says the congressman schemed to launder money from his car dealerships into his campaign coffers, and then tried to get others to cover it up. Many of the questions surrounding Buchanan go back to his auto dealerships in Florida where he made his millions, and back to the days when he worked with his former business partner Sam Kazran. Their partnership started at what is now a weed-filled lot, the former North Jacksonville Hyundai dealership. Eventually they owned four dealerships together. \"I respected him,\" Kazran says of their early years together. \"I believed him.\" But Kazran says he was naive, and that he soon found out the man he believed in was interested in only two things: money and power. \"Mr. Buchanan is a very selfish person, and in my opinion people who go to Congress have got to do good for the people they represent,\" Kazran says. Kazran presented to CNN the same information, documents and testimony he has given to federal investigators. The two men had a falling out over their finances, and they've been suing each other for years. Buchanan says Kazran is a disgruntled partner and has lied about what happened. At the center of Kazran's allegations is a cash swap scheme used to finance some of Buchanan's campaigns. He says employees were forced to write checks, then were reimbursed with cash drawn from Buchanan's car dealerships. \"It was to a point where I said, 'Chief, we can't give you this kind of money. At which point he said, 'Just run it through the corporation,'\" Kazran said. \"What he said to me was 'Get people to write a check to the campaign and then pay them back through the corporation.'\" Kazran did, and he was soon calling in managers, salesman, even assistants. People who never gave money to campaigns were suddenly writing big checks to Buchanan for Congress and, according to Kazran, getting reimbursed from the dealership. It added up to almost $70,000 at Kazran's dealership alone, he said. Senate close to deal to extend low interest rates on student loans . \"I remember one of the partners jokingly saying, 'Boss, you have all the money in the world. Why do you want us to pay you the money?' And he said, 'Well, it doesn't look good if it's coming from me.'\" Kazran took his detailed allegations to the Federal Elections Commission, which was already looking into Buchanan's campaign finances. Investigators there wanted to know not only about how the cash-swap scheme was set up, but if the congressman knew about it. Kazran says there is no question the congressman knew all about it. The FEC's initial report found \"reason to believe\" that Buchanan \"knowingly and willfully violated\" federal election laws. Read the initial FEC report (pdf). But in a later report the FEC pulled back, saying it found credibility problems with both Kazran and Buchanan and not enough corroborating evidence to back up Kazran's testimony. The FEC then dropped the investigation into Buchanan, stating, \"While there is some other evidence in the record that is consistent with Kazran's general allegations, other evidence supports Buchanan's denials or is ambiguous.\" Read the FEC report (pdf). The FEC eventually fined Kazran $5,000 in a settlement because he admitted reimbursing employees for campaign contributions. Kazran has never disputed his involvement, but he says he did it because Buchanan told him to. While the congressman has said the later FEC report proves he's innocent, the findings at the FEC were more convoluted, stating it came \"close to supporting a finding that it is more likely than not\" that Buchanan violated the law. And that's where things get much more serious for the congressman. During the FEC probe, Buchanan pushed to settle a lawsuit Kazran had brought against him. At the last minute, with a $2.9 million settlement offer from Buchanan dangling in front of him, Kazran says he was given an affidavit to sign. According to Kazran, the congressman and his attorneys were asking him to sign a statement that was a lie, that Buchanan knew nothing about the campaign cash swap. Kazran says Buchanan and his team were trying to force him to lie about Buchanan's role in the campaign cash scheme in exchange for the nearly $3 million cash settlement, money which Kazran says he desperately needed, as his finances were in trouble and his wife was suffering from cancer and was undergoing expensive medical treatments. \"A lot of the language of it was really to distance himself...,\" said Kazran. \"In short it said that Mr. Buchanan had nothing to do with it.\" Kazran's lawyer, Robert Stok, says it was clearly an effort to lean on Kazran when he was vulnerable. \"He was holding the settlement in escrow,\" Stok says. \"He basically said, 'We can settle, but there's one little thing remaining. All you have to do is sign this affidavit. We release the settlement and everything will be rosy for you.'\" Kazran refused to sign and took the affidavit to federal investigators. Now, CNN has learned that Buchanan is being investigated for attempting to tamper with a witness in a federal investigation. After CNN's repeated requests for interviews were ignored, CNN decided to find Buchanan as he emerged from a hearing. Buchanan would not respond fully to any questions and quickly walked away from CNN's camera. When asked if he tried to get Kazran to sign the affidavit, Buchanan responded \"No, no, no, no. No I didn't,\" adding that he needed to get to another meeting, and that CNN should contact his office. When asked if he used the affidavit to hold up the $3 million settlement with Kazran, Buchanan replied: \"No.\" In a recent report, released quietly several weeks ago, the Office of Congressional Ethics wrote: \"There is substantial reason to believe that Buchanan attempted to influence the testimony of a witness in a proceeding before the FEC in violation\" of federal law and House ethics code. Read the OCE's report on the affidavit (pdf). Now a full House ethics committee is looking into it. CNN has also learned that the FBI is conducting its own investigation. In addition, the Office of Congressional Ethics also found \"substantial reason to believe\" that Buchanan failed to disclose unearned income on his financial disclosure forms from 2007 to 2010. Read the report (pdf). Salvatore Rosa, a former chief financial officer for Buchanan's business interests for five years, said in a recent deposition conducted by Buchanan's attorney that he submitted a federal whistle-blower complaint to the IRS with allegations that Buchanan violated federal tax laws, including tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy to commit tax evasion. In the deposition, Buchanan's attorneys asked Rosa if he stood to gain a \"financial windfall\" by filing the complaint. Rosa said \"potentially.\" The deposition did not provide details of the alleged violations of tax law. Rosa declined an interview with CNN. Buchanan's office responded to CNN's interview request with a statement saying the charges are \"politically motivated,\" that the congressman did nothing wrong, and \"We are confident that the Justice Department and House Ethics Committee will reach the same conclusion.\" On Friday, lawyers for Buchanan filed a legal motion in Sarasota, Florida, to seal all documents in the Kazran case and to stop Kazran and his lawyers from speaking publicly about it. Buchanan's lawyers said news stories about the congressman are \"publicly disparaging\" his character. Stok said: \"As an American citizen, both Congressman Buchanan and I have the fundamental right of free speech. ... Mr. Buchanan's motion is yet another in a series of frivolous efforts to attempt to shut down the case ... and to conceal his wrongdoing behind a shroud of secrecy.\" CNN's Nicole Boucher contributed to this report.

      "40. NEW YORK (CNN) -- She used to lunch at the exclusive Four Seasons. Now, the best-selling author jokes that she's inviting friends to Taco Bell. Call it gallows humor, but Alexandra Penney has just lost her life's savings. Author and artist Alexandra Penney says she lost her life savings investing with financier Bernard Madoff. She invested every penny with accused Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff. Penney thought she had weathered the bear market just fine, since Madoff put her money in super-safe Treasuries. Then, on December 11, she received a call from her best friend. \"She said, 'I hope this is a rumor, but I've just heard Bernie Madoff's been arrested,' \" Penney recalls. \"My other phone rang; it was my son. And he said, 'Mom, sit down.' He said, 'Bernie Madoff's been arrested.' And I said, 'For what?' And he said, 'He's a crook.' \" Madoff's alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme disrupted a fragile financial system, affecting hedge funds and well-heeled investors on Wall Street, Florida and Europe. In a Ponzi scheme, money from new investors is used to pay off early investors to create the appearance of legitimate returns. Conservative with her money, Penney says she has been working and saving since she was a teenager. She admits that her biggest fear was losing everything and \"becoming a bag lady.\" About a decade ago, when Penney was in her late 40s, she shared her fears with a good friend, who steered her to Madoff, where she thought her money would always be safe. Watch Penney call Madoff 'loathesome' » . Best known for the 1982 best-seller \"How to Make Love to a Man\" and as a former editor of Self magazine, Penney and her friend Evelyn Lauder were the first to use pink ribbons as a symbol for breast cancer awareness. Every success along the way meant more money, which was eventually invested with Madoff. She earned so much money that she was no longer writing and editing but living her dream as an artist. Sitting in her artist's studio in the SoHo area of New York, she recently said she will start writing again to pay the bills. And she has a few choice words about Madoff, who remains under house arrest in his Manhattan penthouse apartment, where he lives with his wife while the case proceeds. \"Repulsive is mild. Loathsome. It's a visceral feeling. This is not humanity; this is not a human being. This is, again, it's a sociopath,\" Penney says. \"I'm sincerely, and this is the understatement of the year, appalled that this man is not in prison.\" But that could change soon if a judge decides to revoke Madoff's bail. In a court filing Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department accused Madoff of having signed about 100 checks -- worth a total of $173 million -- that were \"ready to be sent out\" before his arrest by the FBI on December 11 on a charge of securities fraud.  Madoff investors might have to cough up withdrawals » . Prosecutors said the checks violate his $10 million bail agreement and said it was an attempt to prevent his alleged victims from recovering their losses. If convicted of the charges against him, Madoff, 70, could spend up to 20 years in prison and face a $5 million fine. On the advice of her lawyers, Penney is not saying how much money she lost. She's not penniless, she says. She has a checking account that will last a few months, a West Palm Beach cottage, a Manhattan apartment and a \"beach shack\" in Wainscott, Long Island. Over the past 40 years, she earned and paid for all of it herself. Penney is not asking anyone to feel sorry for her, especially after the acid-response to her first-hand account of her financial woes in a blog called \"The Bag Lady Papers\" on TheDailyBeast.com. In the blog, she talks about selling the cottage and possibly more real estate and taking her first subway ride in 30 years. She's even considered selling some of her expensive jewelry to pay the bills. Some readers blasted her as a privileged New York princess. They told her to get a job. Others said they didn't feel sorry for her. Penney says she was surprised by the \"vitriol.\" \"I've never been given a dollar. I never took alimony. I never inherited any money. So, sure, well, who else earned it? Me,\" Penney says. Today, she says she has been \"Madoffed.\" When the phone rang last month with the news about Madoff's arrest, Penney was making a cheese soufflé. Ever the writer, she uses the soufflé as a metaphor. \"Everything was rising. We were all rising. The housing market was rising. Bernie Madoff's money, people like me, my money was making 9, 10 percent,\" Penney says. \"There was this incredible lift of the economic picture. And I think that the crash of the stock market and the crash of Bernie Madoff together are really emblematic that the system is the culprit. Madoff is emblematic of the system, but there's something very wrong with the system.\" And just like the investments, Penney says, the soufflé fell, too.\n",
      "41. Editor's note: This is part two of a two-part series on illegal immigration in Middle America. St. Bridget's Catholic Church has been spending $80,000 a month to help immigrants pay for their daily expenses. POSTVILLE, Iowa (CNN)  -- The Rev. Lloyd Paul Ouderkirk sits beneath a cross of Jesus, the sun shining through the stained-glass windows that line his church. \"Nobody can tell me to shut up,\" says Ouderkirk, the pastor of St. Bridget's Catholic Church in the tiny town of Postville, Iowa, the epicenter of the nation's immigration debate in rural communities. Ouderkirk is outraged at the way federal agents swooped into town and rounded up nearly 400 illegal immigrants on May 12 in a raid on the nation's largest kosher meatpacking plant, Agriprocessors. He's angry at the bosses of the plant who are accused of mistreating workers, including children, and using a workforce that the government contends was 75 percent illegal immigrants.  Watch \"we cried with them\" » . And he's upset that Iowa Gov. Chet Culver and other top state officials haven't set foot in Postville since the raid left the town of 2,400 \"bleeding to death.\" The raid was the largest work-force raid in the nation's history at the time, what one court interpreter said \"criminalized the undocumented workers on a grand scale\" for the first time. \"I think every elected politician -- no exceptions -- should bow their heads in shame,\" Ouderkirk says. \"Upset?! Yeah, I'm upset. I mean give me a break ... If the elected politicians couldn't do any better than this to come up with a good, just immigration law, they should hang their heads in shame.\" Within the next half hour, about two dozen women from Guatemala and Mexico begin arriving at his church, along with two men. All were picked up in the raid, but the federal government released them on humanitarian grounds because they are parents of children who are American citizens. Each wears an ankle bracelet. They are seeking political asylum or temporary residency within the United States.  See photos around Postville, Iowa » . Unable to work now, they come to St. Bridget's for financial help. The church pays their medical bills, food, rent and other daily expenses. \"They walk the streets here monitored wherever they go. They can't leave, they can't work, they all have children,\" Ouderkirk says. \"So effectively, they are prisoners in our town and in this parish.\" Ouderkirk isn't the only one complaining. Mayor Bob Penrod said his town has been turned \"topsy turvy\" since the raid. He too wondered why he hasn't heard from the governor.   Watch a \"military raid\" on this town » . \"Basically all we wanted was some advice on how to deal with some of the situations that keep arising,\" Penrod says. Gov. Culver's office says his administration played a \"leading role\" in an investigation of the meatpacking plant that led to more than 9,000 charges of child labor violations against its bosses and managers. \"Gov. Culver has been a vocal critic of Agriprocessors,\" his office said in a written statement. It added that while the governor may not have visited, he has worked with state agencies to \"address the needs of the families in Postville.\" Agriprocessors declined comment for this story. In a statement after the raid, the company said it \"cooperated with the government in the enforcement action. We intend to continue to cooperate with the government in its investigation. ... We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families whose lives were disrupted and wish them the best.\" The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stands by the raid in Postville. \"Illegal aliens often turn to criminal activity, including document fraud, Social Security fraud or identify theft, in order to get jobs,\" ICE spokesman Tim Counts said in a written statement. \"The demand for fraudulent documents and identities created by them creates thriving criminal enterprises that supply them.\" Ouderkirk, who came out of retirement after the raid, says it's costing his church $80,000 a month, and the church only has enough money to keep paying through the end of the year. \"It's pathetic when you have what was labeled by the man who directed the raid here as a 'very successful raid.' How successful is this when it does this to the children and breaks up families?\" Ouderkirk says. Rocelia Hernandez, a mother of four, came from Mexico seven years ago and worked at the kosher plant for three years. Displaying her ankle bracelet, she admits she entered the country illegally, but says she came to improve her children's lives. \"Since I arrived here, I haven't done anything but work because I wanted to have a house and have better things in the future for my children,\" Hernandez says. She says she was given a \"Social Security number that they invented for me.\" Asked who made it, Hernandez says, \"I don't know. I never knew.\" Hernandez says she's confused about why the government cracked down on her. The United States, she says, is a generous country that provides aid to countries to help impoverished people around the world. \"If the Americans have such a big heart or the government has such a big heart for other people, why don't they protect those of us who are already here? Why do they kick us out?\" she says. \"I want my son to learn the language and stay here and have a better life,\" Hernandez says of her 5-year-old American-born son. Ouderkirk puts it more succinctly. \"This is no way as a democracy to treat people. I don't care if they are legal or illegal. You don't tear families apart like this,\" Ouderkirk says. \"The women and children we're taking care of right now are no more criminal than people driving down the street breaking the speed limit.\"  See where Postville is located » . The federal government disagrees. Of the 389 captured that day in May, nearly 300 of them were charged with felony counts of aggravated identity theft and fraudulent use of Social Security numbers. Those slaughterhouse workers were tried and convicted in less than two days on a cattle fairground where Iowans typically come to cheer cowboys who lasso raging bulls. Most were sentenced to five months in prison. \"The federal court got taken for a ride,\" says Erik Camayd-Freixas, a federal certified interpreter who was there. \"There was no presumption of innocence.\" A court interpreter is supposed to be an impartial representative of the government. Camayd-Freixas has worked as an interpreter for 23 years, but says what happened in Postville touched a nerve and forced him to speak out. \"The truth is that nothing could have prepared me for the prospect of helping our government put hundreds of innocent people in jail,\" he said in a written personal account. Camayd-Freixas says those arrested pleaded guilty to the charges often not knowing what they were pleading to. A person charged with identity theft has to knowingly take the \"identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of federal law,\" according to federal identity theft law. ICE's affidavit is vague on that point, describing workers going to a third-party source for documents. Most of the Agriprocessor workers, Camayd-Freixas says, had no idea they were using somebody else's identity because they \"took whatever number was given to them.\" Camayd-Freixas says he understands the workers were in America illegally, but he questions the legality of trying them on felony offenses. \"These are common workers and they are parading them as criminals. There's something wrong here,\" he says. \"I was there and I saw it.\" He says the guilty pleas could have a staggering effect on separate, extremely serious state investigations of Agriprocessors. The state of Iowa filed 9,300 misdemeanor charges against owners and managers at Agriprocessors accusing them of child labor law violations. The state needs the immigrants -- the same ones the federal government wants deported -- to testify in any potential trial against their bosses. \"The immigrants have no credibility because they plead guilty,\" Camayd-Freixas says. \"The whole thing is just ill conceived.\" Camayd-Freixas, acting as an academic consultant for the Guatemalan consul general, recently visited with 94 of the Postville workers being held at two facilities in Miami, Florida. Their sentences ended last weekend and they will likely get deported beginning this week. He says 16 have been recalled for the Iowa investigations. \"They want to be deported back to Guatemala as soon as possible,\" Camayd-Freixas says. \"Every week they don't work is another week their children go hungry.\" Back in Postville, Ouderkirk says he'll keep speaking his mind. He invites vocal opponents of illegal immigration to come to his church and \"walk in the shoes\" of the immigrants he's helping. He says he's \"gotten hate letters like you wouldn't believe.\" \"If people have a right to spout off like that, then I have a right to speak in defense of these poor people,\" he says. \"This is a free country. I have a right to speak what I believe in, and I have a right to speak up for poor people whose voice is being denied.\"\n",

H1N1 Response - Find out how public settings help germs spread from person to person. College Costs - Examine the rising costs of college and how some students are paying tuition. Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: On HLN, online, on iTunes. However you're watching us, thanks for checking out CNN Student News. Bringing you today's headlines, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Terror Charge . AZUZ: First up, authorities have charged a man in Massachusetts with planning to provide material support to terrorists overseas. The U.S. attorney for Massachusetts says Tarek Mehanna tried to get training from the Taliban and hoped to attack members of the U.S. government. The official added that those people were never in any danger. The U.S. attorney claims that Mehanna, who you see in this file video, was involved in this conspiracy that lasted for about seven years. If he's convicted on the material support charge, Mehanna could face up to 15 years in prison. TARP Report . AZUZ: A new report says last year's $700 billion could cost the government more than just money. Neil Barofsky, who oversees the program for the Treasury Department, says it could damage the government's reputation with taxpayers, and there's also a risk of rewarding companies that took big chances. The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, was passed following last year's financial crisis. Its goal was to help struggling banks and companies. So far, about 17 percent of the loans that were given out as part of TARP have been repaid. IAEA Talks . AZUZ: Iran has signed off on an agreement to send some of the uranium it makes to other countries for further enrichment. This was the result of talks between Iran, the U.S., France, Russia and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran says part of the reason it accepted the deal was to prove that its nuclear activities are only for peaceful purposes. Other nations have accused the Middle Eastern country of trying to develop nuclear weapons. Afghan Runoff Problems . AZUZ: President Obama says that the U.S. will continue to work with the Afghan government no matter who wins that country's runoff election next month. As we told you about yesterday, the leading candidates from August's election are going to take part in the runoff on November 7th. But as Chris Lawrence explains, there are some potential problems in putting together an election that soon. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Afghanistan is trying to pull off an election on little more than two weeks' official notice. And these are the problems it's facing: logistics, lack of awareness, fraud and fear. DR. ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, AFGHANISTAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The people of Afghanistan were threatened. They lost their fingers in the last round of elections. LAWRENCE: Ink-stained fingers were proof of voting, which made them targets of the Taliban. But a U.S. defense official says there are more American and Afghan troops in place now than in August. And a U.N. official says they're reducing the number of polling stations so security teams won't be spread so thin. On Thursday, the U.N. is launching TV and radio spots, trying to make voters aware there is another election. It's not a given that people know; less than 30% of Afghans can read. A high turnout and a safe election. Those are fine goals for politicians and officials to have. But what about the Afghan people, the ones who may be risking their lives to come out again to cast their vote? We found mixed opinions in this crowded Kabul market. MAN ON THE STREET: We want to build up our country. So despite the problems, I will go to vote in the next election. LAWRENCE: Officials threw out more than a million votes because of suspected fraud. And now, a European Union official says there will be far fewer election monitors for the runoff because the EU can't deploy them all on such short notice. LAWRENCE: Do you trust that your vote will be counted fairly? HABIB HAKIM, KABUL RESIDENT: Uhhh, I don't think so. LAWRENCE: And Habib Hakim can't see how President Karzai or his challenger will improve security. HAKIM: And I'm not sure Dr. Abdullah Abdullah will be able to stop the insurgency in Afghanistan, or at least to limit the level of insurgency in Afghanistan. LAWRENCE: At the least, they want to limit the reach of that insurgency on election day. Chris Lawrence, CNN, Kabul. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . RICK VINCENT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Who is the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Kathleen Sebelius, B) Thomas Vilsack, C) Janet Napolitano or D) Timothy Geithner? You've got three seconds -- GO! Kathleen Sebelius heads up the Health and Human Services Department, which is responsible for protecting Americans' health. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! H1N1 Response . AZUZ: And that puts Secretary Sebelius in charge of the U.S. response to H1N1. Sebelius, who was recently treated for skin cancer above her eye, talked to a Senate committee yesterday about some of the differences between H1N1 and the seasonal flu. U.S. SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Half the hospitalizations for flu-like illness are for people under the age of 25; very different picture than seasonal flu. Nearly 90 percent of the deaths from H1N1 are among people under 65. Again, a very different picture than seasonal flu, where 90% of the deaths year in and year out are for Americans over the age of 65. AZUZ: The World Health Organization has classified H1N1 as a pandemic because of how far this thing has spread around the world. CNN's Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen shows us how germs like the H1N1 virus can transfer from person to person. (BEGIN VIDEO) ELIZABETH COHEN, SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Let's pretend that you and I are going to get on the subway. We stand in line at this kiosk, and let's say I'm sick. I go like this, I touch this, you're right behind me, now it's your turn. DR. RHONDA MEDOWS, GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH: And I'm not so happy with you right now. What happens is, and commonly it happens every single day, is that people who have different illnesses, different symptoms, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, sinus infections, whatever, do the same thing you just did without even thinking about it. H1N1 virus can live on an inanimate object for 2-8 hours. This is a virus that our bodies have never seen before, so all those people who have touched it, if they have H1N1, they have no immunity and neither do you. And this is where the adventure actually starts . COHEN: So, we are now standing behind a whole bunch of people. If one of them were sick and sneezed, could we get sick? MEDOWS: Yes, we can. COHEN: Even at this distance? MEDOWS: It's less than six feet. So that spray, the air droplet spray, could actually come into your being. You're inhaling, you're breathing respiratory droplets. (END VIDEO) No More Fountains . AZUZ: A few moments ago you heard Secretary Sebelius mention it. The H1N1 virus seems to be affecting large numbers of people your age. In order to keep it from spreading, some schools have temporarily shut down, while one Kansas school district is planning to shut down drinking fountains. Students are being urged to bring their own water to class. School officials are even propping doors open to try and keep the handles and the students germ free. Word to the Wise . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... tuition (noun) a charge or fee for instruction, specifically at a private school, college or university . source: www.dictionary.com . College Costs . AZUZ: You know you have to pay tuition when you go to college. But universities get money from alumni and states as well. And when that money decreases, due to a recession, for example, the tuition you pay can increase. For a lot of people, what you can afford is a big part of determining where you're gonna go. And right now, tuition costs are higher than ever. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: Higher education is coming with a higher price tag. Unlike housing in America, college is a serious seller's market. PATRICK CALLAN, NATIONAL CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY & HIGHER EDUCATION: Both the cost and price of higher education have gone up faster than almost anything else in the American economy for 25 years. AZUZ: So, how much money are we talking? According to a new survey by the College Board, if you're planning to go to a public, four-year university in your own state, you're looking at a 6.5 percent increase to around $7,000 dollars per year just for tuition and fees. Public schools in another state: 6.2 percent increase, or more than $18,500 tuition. Private schools: 4.4 percent increase, more than $26,000 per year, tuition. I keep saying \"tuition\" because room and board in each of these categories is also going up, making the yearly totals even more expensive. There is a silver lining, though. About two-thirds of full-time students are getting help in the form of financial aid. And that doesn't have to be paid back. Fine. But what about the third that doesn't get financial aid? Student loans often come into play here, and not surprisingly, borrowing went up five percent for the '08-'09 academic year. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go today, we're talking about video games. They're not just for young people. This bowling tournament is strictly for seniors and it's all about the Wii. About 600 older rollers took to the virtual lanes at this tournament recently in Texas. The goal of these gamers wasn't just to set a world record -- which they did. The event was also designed to encourage seniors to stay fit in order to avoid injuries. Goodbye . AZUZ: Plus, it looks like everyone had a Wii-ly good time. Aw yeah, that's how we roll. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.\n",
      "43. (CNN) -- Police have arrested two people in connection with a cyber-attack that yielded personal details for 12 million customers of one of South Korea's biggest phone companies. One of the suspects, identified only by the surname Kim, used his own customized hacking program to break into the computer system used by KT Corp, Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency Commissioner Lee Sang-Won said in a statement obtained by CNN Thursday. Kim, whom police said was 29 year old, accessed bank details, home addresses and employment information for three-quarters of KT's 16 million registered users. This data was sold on to a 37-year-old man identified only as Park. The owner of a telemarketing business, Park used this information to sell cell phones posing as a KT representative, police said. The two made 11.5 billion won (US$10.8 million) from the scheme, which dated back to February 2013, police added. A third person initially implicated in the case was released. The investigation is now expanding to other hacking activities and other cell phone sales stores. KT said in a statement that it would actively cooperate with the police investigation to \"minimize the damage to its customers,\" and \"figure out the route of information leakage.\" Credit card scam . In January this year, the personal data for 20 million South Korean credit card customers was stolen by a worker at the Korea Credit Bureau -- a company that offers risk management and fraud detection services. The worker, who had access to various databases at the firm, is alleged to have secretly copied data onto an external drive over the course of a year and a half. Clients of three Korean companies -- KB Kookmin Bank, Lotte Card and Nonghyup Bank -- were hardest hit by the data theft. Following this leak, financial regulators have been working to revise legislation to beef up the protection of personal information, the Yonhap news agency reported.\n",
      "44. Washington (CNN) -- Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales could be sentenced to death if convicted on any of the 17 counts of murder filed against him Friday for allegedly embarking on a bloody shooting rampage in Afghan villages, the U.S. military said. In addition to the charges of murder \"with premeditation,\" the 38-year-old faces six counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault. Authorities say Bales left a remote outpost in Kandahar province's Panjwai district early March 11 and went house-to-house, gunning down villagers. U.S. and Afghan officials initially said 16 people died in those attacks. Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, on Friday said only that investigators assigned to the case felt they had evidence to charge Bales with 17 counts of murder. There was no immediate indication as to where the other fatality came from, besides the fact it was an an adult, and Afghan government officials in Kabul have said they have no record of another death. Read the charges against Bales (PDF) The six people wounded in the shootings are four children, one woman and one man, according to the charge sheet against Bales. Two of those have been released from a hospital, said Ahmad Javed Faisal, a Kandahar provincial government spokesman. At the minimum, Bales would be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole if he's convicted on even one of the 17 murder charges, according to a statement from the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan public affairs office. At the maximum, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors could levy more charges \"as they see fit,\" said a defense official with knowledge of the charges preferred. \"The Army investigators are still working,\" the official said. \"There is no requirement to 'lock in' to certain charges at this point.\" Stunned friends recall good deeds of suspect . The Taliban, in an e-mail Friday to CNN, vowed \"strong revenge\" for the attacks and claimed justice won't be served in U.S. courts, which they said \"are not reliable.\" The Islamic fundamentalist group, which been battling coalition and Afghan government forces for years, believes that \"tens of American soldiers, and not one person\" are responsible for the killings, according to the message. \"We don't believe in these (American) courts and reject the decision,\" the Taliban said. \"We will take practical revenge on every single American soldier.\" Bales, who was returned to the United States last week, is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Speaking from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, where Bales is assigned, Army Gen. Lloyd Austin called the developments Friday -- in which U.S. military lawyers in Afghanistan \"preferred\" the charges -- \"the first step in a long process that's going to occur.\" The case is now in the hands of the special convening authority, Col. Kenneth Kamper from the 17th Fires Brigade. As a I Corps unit leader who is still at Lewis-McChord, Kamper handles courts-martial issues regarding Corps members, according to base spokesman Joe Piek. Bales' case could go straight to an Article 32 hearing -- a military hybrid of a civilian preliminary hearing and a grand jury session that Austin, the Army's vice chief of staff, acknowledged has \"challenges associated with it.\" Or Bales could go before a group of mental health experts who would determine whether his mental health may be a factor in his defense. Jeffery King, a military defense lawyer, told CNN on Friday that he expected \"the mental status of ... Bales will be the overriding factor in this case\" -- including both his state of mind at the time of the attack, as well as whether he's mentally competent to stand trial. Eventually, after gathering prosecution and defense testimony, Kamper will recommend what charges should be pursued to a higher-ranking general convening authority, in this case Maj. Gen. Lloyd Miles. As deputy commanding general for I Corps, Miles is taking on this duty while the corps' commanding general, Lt. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, is deployed, Piek said. Miles is expected to offer his own recommendation on whether the case should go to trial and, if so, on what charges and whether a death penalty should be a possible sentence. If and when the case comes to trial, Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, said, it is going to be \"extremely difficult\" for the prosecution. \"They have no murder scene, no forensics,\" the lawyer said Thursday night outside his Seattle office. \"I'm going to make them prove every claim.\" Prosecution faces major hurdles . Military law experts acknowledge that proving the case may be difficult, especially given that there are no autopsies to help prove the cause of death -- in part because those killed were buried quickly, in accordance with Islamic tradition -- and difficulty in getting witnesses to testify. Afghans are insisting that the suspect be returned to Afghanistan to face trial, with villagers and lawmakers questioning the U.S. military's account of what happened. But a military official in Afghanistan has said that Bales will be tried in the United States. Kolb, the ISAF spokesman, said that defense attorneys would need coalition forces' protection if they choose to investigate in Afghanistan. He notes that the Taliban \"has already taken some potshots at Afghan investigators that went to the area.\" Still, Kolb said witnesses may not necessarily have to fly to the United States to testify as they could speak via teleconference. And Gary Solis, a former U.S. Marine Corps lawyer and current Georgetown professor, told CNN that any bullet rounds recovered from the scene could be matched with Bales' weapon -- assuming it was \"immediately seized\" -- which would serve as \"powerful evidence for the government.\" Suspect has memory loss, lawyer says . Lance Rosen, the lawyer for Bales' wife, Karilyn, said Bales did not surrender to U.S. authorities, as some have reported. Rather, Rosen said, Bales was taken into custody, though he wasn't sure why. Asked about Bales' state of mind, Browne said on \"CBS This Morning\" on Friday that his client hasn't said much in their meetings and appears to have memory problems predating the incident. \"He has some memories about what happened before the alleged event and some memories after the alleged event and some windows here and there into things, but he really doesn't have any memory,\" Browne said. \"He's kind of in shock.\" Bales told his wife, in the first of two phone conversations they had since he was detained, that something had happened and he didn't know what it was, according to Rosen. What's the link between violence and disorders? Browne told CBS that \"The Hurt Locker,\" the acclaimed 2008 film about a bomb disposal unit in the Iraq war, is a \"Disney movie compared to what these guys are going through.\" \"Just seeing people blown apart ... picking up body parts, putting them in bags,\" he said. \"You know, a lot of servicemen go through that and don't have incidents alleged like this, but it's pretty horrific. We do know he had a concussive head injury, which is serious. We also know it was not treated for a variety of reasons.\" Afghan villagers describe massacre's horror . Another member of Bales' defense team, Emma Scanlan, said Friday that she'd spoken recently with Bales, and he is \"holding up.\" \"He's concerned about the welfare of his family, first and foremost, and the safety of the people who are on the ground in Afghanistan,\" Scanlan said of the father of two. The massacre has strained already tense U.S.-Afghan relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has demanded that troops withdraw from villages in his nation and return to their larger bases, saying relations between the two countries are \"at the end of their rope.\" Karzai urges U.S. pullback after massacre . CNN legal contributor and defense attorney Paul Callan said on CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" that he believes prosecutors will seek the death penalty against Bales \"because this is one of the biggest alleged massacres in memory.\" \"You have the diplomatic and political problems that are being caused by this crime,\" Callan said. \"Afghan citizens will be looking, saying, 'Is the U.S. seeking justice in this case?' \" But he said that even if prosecutors won a death sentence, it is unlikely that Bales would be executed for years, if not decades. Suspect held liable for financial fraud . Accounts from the military, Bales' family, friends and neighbors describe a man who remained committed to serving his country despite wounds he received during three previous combat tours to Iraq, including a traumatic brain injury suffered during a vehicle accident. But Michael Breen, a former Army captain, said the speculation about whether his injuries or a possible undiagnosed case of post-traumatic stress disorder contributed to Bales' actions is unfair to other veterans. \"Sgt. Bales has been through a lot as a soldier. Many of us have,\" Breen said. \"That is certainly no explanation or excuse for the gross violation of his code of honor, to say the least, and the horrific crimes that he committed.\" CNN's Mitra Mobasherat, Sara Sidner, Chris Lawrence, Miguel Marquez and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.\n",
      "45. (CNN) -- For parents in Somalia, giving their children immunizations is not a choice. In a country enduring more than 20 years of conflict, Somalia is home to one of the highest child mortality rates in the world, with one in five Somali children dying before their 5th birthday, aid agencies say -- in many instances, from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines. Yet for some equally loving parents in the developed world, the messages surrounding childhood vaccination have become muddied. Some communities in areas previously considered disease-free are now falling below the levels of \"herd immunity\" required to protect against diseases such as measles, whooping cough and mumps. This week, in Swansea, Wales, the local public health agency announced that 886 people have been diagnosed with measles in an epidemic that started in November. The outbreak has been attributed to low measles, mumps and rubella immunization rates. One man's death has been linked to the measles virus, while 80 people have been hospitalized. In 2011, six people in France died as a result of a measles epidemic that neared 15,000 confirmed cases, according to the World Health Organization. In 2010, a whooping cough outbreak, resulting from pockets of under-vaccinated people in California, resulted in 10 deaths, according to the California Department of Public Health. Nine of these were infants were too young to be vaccinated. \"We are extremely concerned about what's happening in some parts of the developed world,\" said Jos Vandelaer, chief of immunization at UNICEF, one of the groups helping vaccination efforts in Somalia. \"In the developing world, many people don't even get the chance to be immunized. Health systems are not strong enough to take the vaccine to every child despite the fact that their parents want it.\" Parents with real fears . Measles, whooping cough and Hib (haemophilus influenzae type B), along with many other childhood diseases, can be deadly, but they are vaccine-preventable. Measles alone killed more than 150,000 people globally in 2011, according to WHO. Measles is also highly infectious, with one carrier likely to pass on the virus to between 14 and 18 other susceptible people, said Dr. Matthew Snape of the Oxford Vaccine Group in the pediatrics department at the University of Oxford, England. Despite the severity of these diseases, some parents in the developed world choose not to immunize their children and accept the risks. \"Studies show that it is the upper middle class, well-educated Caucasian parents who are shunning vaccines,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"They have generally gone to graduate school, are in positions of management and are used to being in control.\" A study released this month by the National Health Performance Authority in Australia reflected this trend. A number of affluent Sydney suburbs were identified as regions where low levels of immunity have put entire communities at risk from these diseases. The reasons behind parents' decisions are complex. Part of the problem is lingering doubts around vaccine safety that were compounded by a retracted 1998 study linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism. Although declared an \"elaborate fraud\" by the British Medical Journal, it raised questions about the safety of immunization in the minds of many parents. These doubts then were spread worldwide on the Internet and in the media by anti-vaccination groups and some celebrities. \"If you want to scare yourself about vaccines, it's not that hard,\" Offit said. \"Just turn on your computer.\" For such parents, the perceived risks of vaccination outweigh the risks they associate with disease. Vaccine-autism connection debunked again . In Australia, where vaccination is not mandatory, the anti-vaccination Australian Vaccination Network website says parents need to make an informed choice. The site offers links to articles and parental accounts of the potential side effects of many vaccines. A UNICEF working paper released this week to coincide with World Vaccination Week has tracked the rise of anti-vaccination sentiment in Eastern and Central Europe and concludes that poorly managed immunization campaigns in some countries have also contributed to the problem. Concerned parents in the affected countries are taking to blogs and Facebook, discussing their mistrust of vaccines and government programs, questioning the involvement of pharmaceutical companies and often recommending alternative medicine. A March survey conducted by the U.S. organization Public Policy Polling showed that 20% of Americans believe there is a link between childhood vaccines and autism, and a further 34% were not sure. Diseases long forgotten in the developed world . While there are some risks associated with vaccines, they are mostly minor, such as pain at the vaccine site or low-grade fever, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A serious allergic reaction is rare and usually reported in less than one out of 1 million doses, the agency reported. \"Hundreds of millions of children every year are vaccinated, and the number of side effects we see is minimal,\" UNICEF's Vandelaer said. \"The anti-vaccine groups focus on the potential side effects, not on the real side effects.\" On the question of autism, numerous studies conducted over the past decade have all demonstrated there is no scientific link between vaccines and autism. With so much conflicting information readily available to parents, Dr. Dina Pfeifer, program manager for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization for WHO's Europe office, said she believes the decision of whether to immunize children has become so fraught that many parents choose to do nothing at all. \"They have a difficulty dealing with the amount of information for and against (vaccination) on the Internet, and out of this confusion they are failing to recognize the risks of the disease,\" she said. Another factor driving parents' decision not to vaccinate is the security that comes with herd vaccination, as rates of immunization for many diseases remain above 92% for the population. But Europe's recent battle with measles demonstrates the problems under-vaccinated populations can pose, especially with older children. \"Europe had 100,000 cases of measles from 2009 to 2012, and that shows how prevalent the pockets of un-immunized populations are in that area,\" Pfeifer said. \"Almost 50% of those cases were older than 10 years of age, and the older you are when you contract measles, the more severe the course of the disease.\" Another factor of these pockets is their affluence; these parents tend to be the ones able to afford overseas travel. In 2008, a 7-year-old U.S. boy whose parents chose not to immunize him against measles traveled with his family to Switzerland. He caught the virus and returned to San Diego, unknowingly exposing 839 people to the disease and infecting 11 unvaccinated children, according to the journal Pediatrics. In Europe and the United States, parents and most people under 45 have never seen the effects of diseases such as measles, diphtheria or polio. \"The fear factor (among parents in the developed world) is missing now -- the knowledge of what's on the other side if you don't have vaccinations,\" said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, known as GAVI Alliance. The lack of knowledge of these diseases is also a problem among younger doctors and pediatricians, who may not be able to identify the signs, resulting in misdiagnoses. \"There is a lot of value in case-based learning, but it is difficult to learn how to recognize these diseases if you haven't seen them before,\" said WHO's Pfeifer. In contrast, most parents in the developing world, in places such as Somalia, have seen family members suffer, be maimed or die from such diseases, health advocates said. Education and motivation . To address the problem, Berkley prescribes localized programs in countries to supplement the already high overall levels of immunization. Other physicians are supporters of parental education and want to ensure parents feel free to ask as many questions of their doctors and health care workers. Dr. Steve Hambleton of the Australian Medical Association said further motivation may be necessary. \"When you incentivize the parents in a meaningful way, whether it be financial or with other incentives, you can make an enormous difference in vaccination uptake,\" he said. Berkley, a doctor who specializes in epidemiology and global health, said he has seen the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable diseases in war-torn countries and refugee camps. Berkley said he wished he could take some parents in the developed world \"on a tour, show them how horrible it is. Show them the illness that occurs out of these viruses.\" \"We've brought down child mortality dramatically with these vaccination campaigns and we are making dramatic progress, but the challenge is getting people to understand what the world was like before this.\"\n",
      "46. Los Angeles (CNN) -- The unfolding saga of the Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Donald Sterling touches upon big, explosive issues in American society: Racism. Money. Sports. Secret recordings. And an estranged marriage. Sterling, an attorney and billionaire real estate mogul, is now fighting to keep his co-ownership of the NBA franchise after the league said it would ban him forever in the wake of allegations that he disparaged African-Americans in an audio recording. The Sterling controversy contains as many surprises and exchanges as the ongoing NBA playoffs, which, by the way, still include the Clippers in contention for the league title. In fact, on Thursday, the attorney for Sterling's wife, the other co-owner, told CNN that she's distancing herself from her husband and has informed the NBA she wants the team in her name. How the scandal began . Last month, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the league was imposing a lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine against Donald Sterling, co-owner of the Clippers since 1981, for \"offensive and disturbing\" remarks he made about blacks. Those remarks were uttered in an audio recording published by the celebrity news outlet TMZ, which asserted the two people talking on the tape were Sterling and his \"girlfriend,\" V. Stiviano. TMZ hasn't stated who made the recording or how it was obtained. But Silver said the Clippers owner \"acknowledged it was his voice on the tape.\" CNN hasn't independently confirmed the audio recording. Sterling and Stiviano haven't returned CNN's calls for comment. In a recent interview with ABC's Barbara Walters, however, Stiviano tacitly confirmed the authenticity of the recording when she stated she and Sterling often discussed race: \"There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one.\" In the recording, Sterling argues with Stiviano about how she posted to Instagram a photo with legendary NBA player Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" Sterling says. \"If it's white people, it's OK?\" the woman responds. \"If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?\" Bird was also a NBA star who played with the Boston Celtics and a storied rival of Johnson, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers. \"I've known [Magic] well and he should be admired .... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately,\" the man on the recording says. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put [Magic] on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games.\" When the woman says she doesn't share the man's views about race, he tells her: \"Well, then, if you don't feel -- don't come to my games. Don't bring black people, and don't come.\" Stiviano's response . In her only substantial interview, Stiviano, 31, told ABC that Sterling, 80, is now hurting. \"Tormented. Emotionally traumatized,\" Stiviano said. About her relationship with Sterling, Stiviano said she plays a big role in his life, but they are not romantically involved. \"I love him just like a father figure,\" she told ABC. She also described herself as his \"right-hand man,\" \"confidant,\" and \"best friend.\" They also have a financial arrangement, she said. \"He at first started paying me as an employee, and then he started paying me off the books,\" she said. Her attorney, Mac E. Nehoray, said Stiviano was a platonic friend of Sterling's and not his \"girlfriend\" or, as some media outlets, including CNN, put it, his \"mistress.\" \"They were more like friends. Platonic,\" Nehoray told CNN. Stiviano is writing about book about her life, but she doesn't have a book deal connected to the Sterling controversy, Nehoray said. Even before the racial controversy erupted, Sterling's wife, Shelly, was well aware of Stiviano. In fact, in March, Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano, accusing her of having an affair with her husband and targeting extremely wealthy older men. Stiviano's attorney dismissed as \"absolutely false\" any description of Stiviano as a \"gold digger\" and a \"con artist.\" Shelly Sterling's suit claims that her husband used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. Stiviano also took over a $1.8 million duplex through fraud and received about $250,000 in cash from Sterling, the court document claims. Stiviano is fighting back, saying in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts. She also says she never took advantage of him. Donald Sterling's response . Sterling had largely been silent on the controversy. The only significant comment he made was published last week on DuJour.com, which quoted Sterling as saying \"I wish I had just paid her off\" in reference to Stiviano. The website specified that Sterling was referring to Stiviano in a discussion with one of its writers, but the publication didn't state when the remark was made. CNN couldn't independently confirm the remark. On Thursday, however, another celebrity news outlet, RadarOnline.com, published a new audio recording of Sterling conversing with an unknown man about allegations of Sterling being a racist. Sterling emphatically denies being a racist in the conversation. \"You think I'm a racist?\" Sterling tells a person Radar Online calls \"a long-time friend in the recorded phone conversation.\" \"You think I have anything in the world but love for everybody? You don't think that! You know I'm not a racist!\" Sterling says on the recording. \"I grew up in East L.A. ...\" Sterling continues. \"I was the president of the high school there. I mean, and I'm a Jew! And 50% of the people there were black and 40% were Hispanic. ... So I mean, people must have a good feeling for me.\" CNN couldn't independently confirm the new audio recording. Radar Online said it obtained \"a secret audio recording\" from an unidentified source who also provided an affidavit confirming the phone call was made by Sterling. Sterling also declares in the recording that he won't sell his co-ownership in the Clippers as the NBA is now demanding. \"You can't force people to sell property in America,\" Sterling says. At one point in the conversation, Sterling sounds bewildered when the friend tells him that rapper-producer Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is among the celebrities seeking to buy the Clippers. Friend: \"I'm just saying they got Sean Combs Diddy... Sterling: \"Who?\" Friend: \"Sean Combs and Oprah.\" What's next for the Clippers . The \"Oprah\" cited on the recording is Oprah Winfrey, who is among a long list of public figures reportedly seeking to buy the Clippers, one of 30 teams in the NBA. Other interested celebrities include Floyd Mayweather Jr., ranked by Forbes as one of the highest-paid athletes in the world; former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya; basketball great Magic Johnson; producer-musician Dr. Dre; rapper Rick Ross; music mogul David Geffen; Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison; Rick Caruso, a real estate developer and Los Angeles civic leader; and actors Matt Damon, Whoopi Goldberg and Frankie Muniz. Meanwhile, Shelly Sterling has no intention of surrendering her stake in the team and has been in touch with the NBA about keeping the team, according to her attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, who spoke Thursday to CNN. Shelly Sterling owns 50% of the team, and her husband the other 50%, through a family trust, O'Donnell said. O'Donnell asserted that as of now, \"she's the owner in charge.\" The couple continue to share properties, he added. But the Sterlings have been estranged and not living together for more than a year, O'Donnell said. Moreover, Shelly Sterling is now distancing herself from the racist comments attributed to her husband, O'Donnell said. \"Mrs. Sterling has denounced in the strongest terms possible terms her husband's racist comments,\" O'Donnell said. Whether Shelly Sterling can keep the team in her name is being robustly discussed by analysts. Complicating the matter is how Donald Sterling intends to fight the forced sale, according to the RadarOnline.com recording. Donald Sterling could be forced to sell his team if three-quarters of the NBA team owners agree, NBA Commissioner Silver said. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that for all practical purposes, the NBA effort to make Donald Sterling sell the team also applies to his wife. \"They're the same ownership group. That is not separate ownership,\" Toobin said. As for the Clippers' more immediate prospects, the team is now tied 1-1 with the Oklahoma City Thunder in a best-of-seven-games playoff series. Both teams are vying to advance to the Western Conference playoffs, whose winner will play for the league title against the Eastern Conference winner. The Clipper's next game is Friday night at home, though the team's off-court drama is proving to be equally compelling. CNN's Stephanie Elam and Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report.\n",
      "47. Johannesburg (CNN) -- \"This shouldn't be happening\" -- these were the words of a visibly nervous and frustrated sheriff of the court as he rang the outside bell and knocked at the gate belonging to a woman still considered by many in South Africa as the \"mother of the nation.\" Joe Maluleke and two other officials arrived at Winnie Mandela's house in Soweto on Tuesday to execute a court order granting a Johannesburg school permission to auction her belongings and pay an old debt. Among the goods meant to go under the hammer were 50 paintings, a round table, chairs and a silver tea set. The problems started when the ex-wife of Nelson Mandela, the country's first black president and an international icon, registered her great niece, Nobantu Vutela, as a boarding student at Abbotts College in Northcliff, Johannesburg, according to court papers filed in 2008. The accommodation fees for the year were 40,000 South African rand -- the equivalent of about $4,000 today. Winnie Mandela, 76, who earns an annual salary of around $90,000, as a member of parliament, was given six months to pay the full amount. It's unclear why she and not the girl's own parents enrolled her into the private school. Despite the documents stipulating that R10,000 ($1000) be paid up front, lawyers representing the school say Mrs Mandela never paid a cent. They started instituting proceedings against her in October 2008. The case dragged on for five years. A lawyer acting on behalf of the school told CNN Mrs Mandela made her first payment last year but that she still owes nearly $5,000 with interest included. Mrs Mandela's lawyer is disputing the interest amount. With dozens of journalists surrounding him, not a single bidder in sight, and Mrs Mandela's bodyguards stationed on the other side of the wall, Sheriff Maluleke knocked in vain. People could be seen moving around inside and outside the house, but nobody came out to let the sheriff in. At one point a car sped out of the premises using a side entrance. It is unclear who was in the car. Maluleke was instructed by lawyers to get a locksmith and force his way into Mandela's house, but he was understandably reluctant. At one point a spectator shouted, \"Why don't you climb over the wall?\" The sheriff's irritated retort: \"And get shot at?\" The tense standoff lasted for about two hours. Maluleke left Winnie Mandela's property empty-handed and dejected. He later admitted that the task he was expected to carry out was a difficult one. \"Is it because she is the mother of the nation?\" he was asked. \"Exactly,\" he responded. Read this: How South Africa avoided 'bloody racial war' On Monday night Winnie Mandela's lawyer Yandisa Dudula had been frantically trying to stop the auction from going ahead. \"Mrs. Mandela has given me a check for R16,000 ($1,696), and another R4,000 ($212) has been given to the sheriff,\" he told CNN. \"The auction is not necessary.\" The school's lawyers insisted on getting the money in cash, failing which, they said the sale of her goods would go ahead as planned. Confused neighbors looked on as the spectacle at Mandela's property unfolded. \"We thought she had money, it is very surprising that her goods are now having to be auctioned in order to recoup funds for a debt,\" one of them told CNN. When asked what it is like to live next door \"the mother of the nation,\" the neighbor said, \"We never see her. When the old man (Nelson Mandela) lived in Soweto he would walk around, shake people's hands, greet and talk to them, he even invited us into his home.\" \"Winnie keeps to herself, but we still call her 'mother of the nation' and no-one wants to see her humiliated,\" the neighbor said. Commentators say Winnie Mandela has become increasingly isolated, not only by her political family, the ruling African National Congress, but seemingly by her biological family as well. \"Internal tensions within the family could have played a role in no one coming to Mrs Mandela's aid,\" political analyst Somadoda Fikeni told CNN. \"The family is fragmented and recent squabbles over money have further emphasized these divisions.\" Two of Nelson Mandela's daughters -- Makaziwe Mandela and Zenani Dlamini -- are currently embroiled in a legal battle over the former political prisoner's money. They have filed court papers in an attempt to remove Mandela's longtime lawyer and friend, 84-year-old George Bizos, and others as directors of companies owned by the Mandela Trust. The children's legal battle over their iconic father's monies has come under heavy criticism in South Africa. Bizos told local media the lawsuit is \"a ploy to resuscitate the sale of Mandela's artworks\" whose proceeds go to the companies at the center of the dispute. Andrew Mlangeni, who was incarcerated on Robben Island with Mr Mandela, told CNN: \"This is a matter that should have been resolved internally within the family.\" Makaziwe recently rebutted accusations that her intentions are motivated by greed, telling the New York Times: \"This issue that we are greedy, that we are wanting this money before my dad passes away is all nonsense.\" The feud over Nelson Mandela's millions and now the threat of an auction at his former wife's residence underscore the contradictions and complexities in what many consider South Africa's political \"royal family.\" Read this: Big brands target South Africa's middle class . This is by no means Winnie Mandela's first brush with the law, although for years many saw her as untouchable. The former freedom fighter was implicated in the 1980s murder of 14-year-old anti-apartheid activist Stompie Seipei. Her then-husband, Nelson Mandela, stood by her, despite a mountain of damning evidence. In 1991 she was convicted of kidnapping Seipei and for being an accessory to assault, but her six-year jail term was reduced on appeal to a fine and a suspended sentence. In 2003 Mrs Mandela was convicted for theft and fraud in connection with an elaborate bank loan scheme where the ANC party letterhead was used to obtain loans for bogus employees including her youngest daughter Zinzi. The conviction carried a jail term, but that sentence too was suspended. A few months ago police confirmed that they have reopened the murder case of two more former freedom fighters, allegedly last seen at her house more than 20 years ago. Their bodies were exhumed in March. In recent years, \"the mother of the nation's\" influence in the country and within the ruling party has waned, and the protection she once enjoyed along with it. Last year she was voted second-last in the party's national executive committee. She had been top of the list at the previous ANC conference in 2007. Still, respected columnist and journalist Justice Malala says he is astonished Winnie Mandela couldn't get help from a single one of her former comrades. Malala told CNN: \"It's great that she was paying for her great niece's school fees but I'm surprised that firstly she didn't feel she could raise the money from her own salary and secondly that no-one in the ANC was willing to help her. She could have also approached the Mandela Trust. Mandela has given money to president Jacob Zuma before when he was in trouble.\" Perhaps the most astonishing part of the tale is why her children and grandchildren appear to have stood by and watched as threats of an auction became more serious. Two of her grandchildren, Zaziwe and Swati Dlamini have recently launched a reality show in the U.S. called \"Being Mandela.\" They also have a clothing line named \"Long Walk to Freedom\" after their grandfather's autobiography. Their mother Zenani Dlamini, Winnie's eldest daughter, is South Africa's ambassador to Argentina. Despite the family's many ventures and connections, Winnie's lawyer says money isn't always readily available. Winnie Mandela has often courted controversy, but she is still adored by many in South Africa. She endured years of torture, torment, banishment and imprisonment by the apartheid regime while fighting resolutely for racial equality in the country. And despite her legal and financial troubles over the years, very few South Africans are celebrating her downfall. Many of them took to Twitter to express their solidarity. \"We cannot forget Winnie Mandela who stood tall for three decades\" wrote one person.\n",
      "48. (CNN) -- The player tumbles to the ground, writhing around as if he has been mortally wounded. Television replays, however, show that his opponent has made no contact at all. It's an ever-increasing sight on football grounds around the world, and -- in the English Premier League, at least -- it's becoming an increasingly emotive issue. Santi Cazorla was labeled a \"con artist\" after his theatricals earned Arsenal a match-turning penalty kick in a game against West Brom on Saturday. Earlier this season, Liverpool's Luis Suarez was the subject of countless negative headlines as he went to ground in the penalty area, and Tottenham's Gareth Bale has been booked four times for diving -- double that of any other EPL player. The scourge of trying to win free-kicks, and especially penalties, in such a way has long been a thorn in football's side, with fans often outraged by what they see as sporting fraud. CNN's very own Arsenal fanatic Piers Morgan took to Twitter to decry Cazorla's actions, saying he was \"ashamed to see an Arsenal player cheat so badly.\" One man who has also never been short of opinions on the subject of cheating is former World Anti-Doping Agency chairman Dick Pound. The Canadian lawyer presided over WADA from its inception in 1999 until 2007, a year when cycling's governing body tried to sue him for critical comments about its former chief Hein Verbruggen. Pound had earned the wrath of Union Cycliste Internationale for saying it could do more to target doping, but his words were comprehensively borne out years later by the U.S. Anti Doping Agency's report into Lance Armstrong, in which everyday items such as butter (apparently short-hand for the hormone EPO) and olive oil (the vehicle for absorbing testosterone) took on very different meanings. Pound believes there are five main reasons why athletes resort to performance-enhancing drugs -- considered by most sports fans to be the worst form of cheating. \"There are reasons but then there are also excuses,\" he told CNN. \"1. A desire to win at all costs -- even if that means lying. 2. For financial reasons -- with professionals trying to extend a career. 3. National pressures -- as exemplified by the old East German system. 4. Individual pressure from coaches -- who get paid better if they coach winners, and that can apply for administrations too. 5. Finally, they dope because they believe they will not get caught -- they believe they are invincible.\" On the latter point, the sad truth is that many do successfully beat the drug testers, as did Armstrong and his former U.S. Postal teammate George Hincapie, who confessed all in a plea bargain in October. 'Leveling the playing field' \"Early in my professional career, it became clear to me that, given the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by cyclists at the top of the profession, it was not possible to compete at the highest level without them,\" said Hincapie, who decided to end his 18-year top-level career. His account tallies with the view of Ellis Cashmore, a professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University in England who has conducted research into the use of drugs in sport. \"I don't think there's a conscious motivation when people dope to gain an unfair advantage. My strong belief is that they are trying to level the playing field, knowing that there are so many others doping that they will be disadvantaged if they don't,\" says Cashmore, whose low opinion of drug testers and high hopes for healthier athletes makes him that rarity -- a public advocate for the use of drugs in sports. \"I won't divulge names but one sprinter, who doped with impunity, told me: 'For several years, I was coming fourth or fifth despite training as hard as I could. Yet I knew that the people beating me weren't training as hard nor did they have the same athletic capacity.' \" So the sprinter doped -- with the \"leveling the playing field\" argument used by many sportsmen, including Ben Johnson's coach Charlie Francis, who said the disgraced Canadian was left with no alternative given the riddled nature of athletics at the time he was winning, then losing, the 1988 Olympic 100 meters final. The plunge into drugs is also tempting because it tends to lead to ever-increasing fortunes, with better performances leading to better results and hence greater earnings. \"If you use drugs, it's because you want a shortcut -- a shortcut to everything,\" says South African athlete Hezekiel Sepeng, a silver medalist at the 1996 Olympics whose career ended in controversy when he tested positive for an anabolic steroid. \"Once you start winning, sponsors will be attracted and then money will come. It is an easy way to make money. Some athletes will dope for four to five years without being caught and will make a lot of money in that time,\" the former 800m specialist, now 38, told CNN. \"The big problem in South Africa is that our sportsmen compare themselves internationally. They are young, they've heard about doping and their mind tells them that they need drugs to beat the rest -- it's all about meeting goals and people wanting quick money.\" Pre-USADA, Armstrong had amassed a $70 million fortune according to Forbes magazine, while fellow American Marion Jones had several multimillion-dollar sponsorship deals before the sprinter's drug admission prompted her supersonic fall from grace. 'Sophisticated skulduggery' At the other end of the scale, lying to earn more money is rampant in African football, where countless \"promising\" players have concocted false -- and younger -- ages in a bid to appear more enticing to any potential Western suitors (and thus secure a way out of poverty). This year Somalia was thrown out of the 2013 African Under-17 Championship qualifiers, while Niger was disqualified from the 2009 tournament for fielding a 22-year-old and its host Nigeria dropped several of its squad following age tests. While that might seem an almost understandable form of cheating, the infamous actions of Soviet pentathlete Boris Onishchenko at the 1976 Olympics are anything but. The three-time Soviet world champion employed sophisticated skulduggery as he rewired his epee so that it would score points when it did not deserve to, as he tried to turn the silver medal he had won four years previously into gold. His \"desire to win at all costs\" earned him the nickname \"Dis-Onishchenko\" -- though little was heard of him after the Montreal Games. It is unclear whether Onischenko had acted with the help of the Soviet team, a subject that had great relevance at the time given the ideological battles -- and sporting subterfuge -- of the Cold War. Onischenko aside, the 1976 Olympics were also notable for the second-place finish in the medal table achieved by East Germany. A country of just 16 million, it was one of the dominant powers in sports such as swimming and track in the 1970s and early '80s -- which was later explained by the state-sponsored doping system that was uncovered after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Many athletes were unwittingly doped, with British newspaper The Guardian reporting in 2005 that an estimated 800 later suffered serious health issues. The most public face of the scandal was Heidi Krieger, a female shot-putter who was given so many steroids that she later opted to have a sex change and is today known as Andreas. While East Germany's rulers felt sporting glory suitably reflected the successes of their political ideology, so prompting their top-down approach, soccer star Diego Maradona did it the other way -- waging war, quite literally, single-handed. After his \"Hand of God\" goal in the 1986 World Cup helped Argentina beat England, one of football's all-time greats justified his deception by referencing his country's unhappiness over the 1982 Falklands War. Argentina lay claim to the islands, which it calls Las Malvinas, over which the British have sovereignty. As clearly seen, the pressure to succeed often takes sportsmen and women into unexpected territory. We are often told that tiny factors make the difference in top-level sports, yet the measures used to gain them are often anything but insignificant. Examples abound -- but how many can prove the point better than Nelson Piquet Jr.'s intentional crash in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, following team orders, which enabled Renault teammate Fernando Alonso to win the race after the safety car came out? With F1 teams spying on one another, boxers loading their gloves with weights, marathoners crossing the finishing line without running the distance, rugby players using fake blood capsules to feign injury (and so enable a team substitution) and Spain's 2000 Paralympic basketball gold medalists later stripped of their title after nearly all their team were revealed to have no disability, arguably the very concept of \"sport\" has been defeated. There may even be a measure of sympathy for the international sports bureaucracy -- the men and women running global sport's governing bodies. They would seem to need a full-time investigation unit to weed out all the ingenious methods being used to cheat. With that in mind, is it any wonder that FIFA -- as it tackles the debilitating threat of organized match-fixing in soccer -- has enlisted the help of worldwide police agency Interpol in recent years?\n",
      "49. London (CNN) -- Police in London were on Friday questioning a suspected rogue trader arrested after Swiss banking giant UBS discovered an estimated $2 billion worth of unauthorised deals. The man -- named by British media as UBS trader Kweku Adoboli -- was held on suspicion of fraud in an early-morning operation in London's banking district hours before the loss was announced on Thursday, officers said. CNN has not independently confirmed his identity, but was told when calling his desk at UBS that he was not available. The bank declined to comment on the arrest. A $2 billion rogue trading loss would be all but unprecedented, market analyst Ralph Silva told CNN. \"We have only had three or four other situations... in the billions, and that is exactly what happened,\" he said. The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said. Shares in UBS rose slightly in early trading in Europe Friday after falling around 10% the day before. Brokers tell CNN the unauthorized trade in question at UBS was likely on an exchange traded fund (ETF) -- a structured instrument based on one or more underlying assets -- that is sold as a fund but trades like a stock. The ETF in question was one which tracked the volatile silver futures market and was priced in Swiss francs, they say. Adoboli's job would have been to hedge, or reduce, the bank's risk on the silver and franc positions by buying and selling each. It is thought that he may accidentally have left the Swiss franc vs U.S. dollar side of the equation uncovered and got stung when the Swiss national bank intervened to defend the franc in early September. Credit rating agency Moody's has said it is looking at UBS for a possible downgrade. Its review of UBS will focus on \"ongoing weaknesses in the group's risk management and controls\" as revealed by the reported loss, Moody's said in a statement. Moody's downgraded two French banks earlier this week amid questions over their exposure to debt. News of the alleged rogue trader comes amid pronounced economic anxiety in Europe. Markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that Greece might default on its huge debt, sending shock waves through the 17-nation eurozone and further afield. Rogue trader's impact on UBS . U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is attending a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed. Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies are also present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month. On Thursday -- even as news was circulating of the incident at UBS -- came word that the Federal Reserve and four other powerful central banks announced they were throwing a lifeline to Europe's struggling banks. The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt. European banks have seen U.S. dollars flow out as U.S. financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to European banks, amid fears over those institutions' exposure to debt held by Greece and other European nations.

Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies will also be present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month. As to the epidosde at UBS, Silva, the analyst, outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place: intentional fraud, \"basic stupidity\" in trading strategy, or what the banking industry calls \"fat fingers,\" which means typing the wrong number by accident. Perhaps the trader \"put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem,\" Silva said. Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job. \"Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year,\" said van Dam. \"With the volatility in banking stocks, commodities and currencies, things can go wrong really, really easily. If you're worried about your job and you try to hide (a mistake or loss), you can see how these situations arise.\" A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said. \"He must have done something that he wasn't supposed to do, obviously,\" van Dam said. UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated. But the \"unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank\" could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said. The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading. Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year. Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the global copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997. Nick Leeson, the subject of the Ewan McGregor movie \"Rogue Trader,\" lost about $1.3 billion for his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close. UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said. There is a \"much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up\" into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients' exposure to investment banking losses, he said. He favors that alternative, he said. \"The banks are too large,\" van Dam said. \"The products are so complicated, and the management doesn't understand it.\" UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that.

      "50. (CNN) -- Everything Kim Dotcom does is mega. He's a mountain of a man with an imposing multi-million dollar fortune, amassed through a series of Internet ventures, which is now being spent on ambitious bid to unseat the current New Zealand prime minister. Dotcom's story starts in 1974, when he was born Kim Schmitz in Germany. He first attracted the attention of authorities in his early 20s when he was convicted of a number of offenses, including computer fraud. He's now wanted by the U.S. for alleged copyright infringement on a grand scale. According to indictment filed in 2012, Dotcom -- who legally changed his name -- and six associates are accused of being members of \"a worldwide criminal enterprise\" dubbed the \"Mega Conspiracy.\" OPINION: Dotcom: Why New Zealand is a slave to U.S. interests . The allegations . Through a number of websites, including cloud storage company Megaupload, they're accused of reproducing and distributing copies of copyright works including \"motion pictures, television programs, musical recordings, electronic books, images, video games, and other computer software.\" The enterprise is estimated to have made $175 million, and deprived copyright owners, including Hollywood production houses, of more than $500 million in revenue, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Dotcom maintains Megaupload was merely a file storage site, and the company should not be held responsible for the content users were uploading. \"I should never have been charged criminally for a civil case. The charges are outrageous and wrong. The case against me is a contract prosecution for Hollywood,\" he told CNN. 'Hollywood' raid . In January 2012, New Zealand police, acting in conjunction with the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice, launched a Hollywood-worthy raid on the sprawling property Dotcom was leasing in Auckland, New Zealand. According to a New Zealand police statement, officers swooped on \"Dotcom Mansion\" in two marked helicopters, and had to cut their way into a safe room where the multi-millionaire had taken refuge -- a version of events that was later contested in court. Dotcom has called the raid \"needlessly theatrical\" and a further attempt by U.S. authorities to smear his image. He and three associates were arrested and are all still fighting efforts to return them to the U.S. The next hearing is scheduled for early 2015. READ MORE: New Zealand's dirty election . Lavish lifestyle . During the raid, officers seized 18 luxury vehicles, including \"several top end Mercedes, a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe and a 1959 pink Cadillac,\" the police statement said, adding to the image cultivated by Dotcom of being a big-spending lover of luxury. The estate he was leasing and later bought -- one of the most expensive in New Zealand -- is a monument to wealth. According to a journalist who visited the property in 2012, it was a \"$24 million suburban castle with ponds, a tennis court, several pools, a Vegas-style stairstep fountain, and a hedgerow labyrinth.\" On his Twitter profile, Dotcom describes himself as an \"entrepreneur, innovator, gamer, artist, fighter, father of five.\" This year he separated from his wife of five years, Mona Dotcom, who was recently photographed in an Auckland nightclub with Prime Minister John Key's 19-year-old son, Max. She told the New Zealand Herald that the teenager happened to be at the same club. \"I didn't know him and had never met him before. He's kind, and we had a fun night together,\" she said. On Wednesday, Dotcom tweeted to his 366,000 followers: \"Mona Dotcom parties with John Key's son. Can my life get more bizarre? Where's the guy who says \"You've been punk'd?\" Anti-establishment . The 2012 raid on Dotcom's property set off a wave of legal proceedings, pitting the entrepreneur against New Zealand authorities, who had responded to a U.S. call for help to find the alleged fugitive. At issue was the legality of police search warrants and the FBI's seizure of electronic information. This year, a New Zealand appeals court ruled the raid was legal, however the seizure of electronic data was not. Months after the raid, an investigation by the Inspector-General of Intelligence found that the nation's spy agency -- the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) -- had conducted illegal surveillance on Dotcom before officers moved in. At the time of the raid, the GCSB only had jurisdiction over foreign nationals; Dotcom was granted residency in 2010 and should have been protected, the prime minister said in a public apology. \"I apologise to Mr Dotcom, I apologise to New Zealanders because every New Zealander that sits within the category of having permanent residency or is a New Zealand citizen is entitled to be protected from the law when it comes to the GCSB, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him,\" Key said. The law has since been changed to make such surveillance legal, a development which has, in part, prompted Dotcom to join the political realm. The Internet Party . Earlier this year, Dotcom launched his own political party, the Internet Party, which aims to \"modernize New Zealand, give the Internet generation a voice in politics, become a leader in the Internet economy and fight for Internet Freedom,\" he said. It's teamed up with Maori nationalist campaigners, the Mana Party, to contest the national election on September 20. Because he's not a citizen, Dotcom can't stand as a candidate but he's put his financial clout -- some $4.5 million -- behind what some see as an unlikely coalition in attempt to chip away at Key's political power. In an opinion piece for CNN.com, Dotcom said under Key's leadership, the country had \"quietly morphed into the political equivalent of an American slave, responding more readily to the interests that motivate the United States than to the concerns of Kiwis.\" On Monday -- five days before the vote -- Dotcom has promised to reveal potentially damaging information on Key and the country's role in international surveillance. However, he said he's not confident the revelations will dent Key's popularity. For his part, Key has said he's \"not losing any sleep\" over potential revelations from his new political rival. New Zealand can decide for itself on Monday, when Dotcom is scheduled to address the media. Whatever the reaction, it is clear Dotcom intends to remain a thorn in the side of the New Zealand government for some time to come. READ MORE: 'House of Cards' in the South Pacific .\n",
      "51. New York (CNN) -- Gigi Jordan showed no emotion as a New York prosecutor described to a jury a \"chilling and horrifying scenario\" in which the businesswoman who made a fortune in pharmaceuticals allegedly concocted a lethal cocktail of painkillers and anti-inflammatories and forced her 8-year-old autistic son to swallow it. \"Two fresh bruises on his nose, fresh bruises on his chin and chest suggest she got on top of him and, hopefully while he was asleep, filled a syringe with the poisonous concoction and pressed that plunger into his body,\" said assistant district attorney Matt Bogdanos, demonstrating how she might have squeezed his nose and pressed open his mouth to deliver the poison. \"His fate was sealed,\" Bogdanos said. \"He didn't die fast. One by one, his vital organs shut down. It didn't take minutes. It took hours to die.\" But on the first day of Jordan's sensational second-degree murder trial -- expected to last months -- defense attorney Allan Brenner painted a starkly different portrait. Brenner described Jordan as a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill Jude Mirra by her two former husbands: One who had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left the boy with his biological father, who she believed had sexually abused Jude. In packed Manhattan criminal courtroom Wednesday, no one disputed the unthinkable manner in which little Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010. Police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. The call to police came after a relative of Jordan was unable to reach her. At an autopsy, four of the painkillers and anti-inflammatories used to kill Jude were recovered undigested from his stomach, prosecutors said. Orange juice and vodka were used to wash down the drugs. While Jude lay dying, Bogdanos said, Jordan sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account. Brenner said Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt. The prosecution sought to show the jury that the killing was premeditated and that Jordan expected to survive. Bogdanos said Jordan \"went to the bank, she transferred $8 million from savings to checking. She checked in (at the hotel) without a reservation and paid cash.\" The exact time of the boy's death could not be determined, but Jude's body temperature was 80 degrees, suggesting that when police arrived, he had been dead for eight to 14 hours, Bogdanos said. Police found a variety of drugs, which the prosecutor enumerated for the jury. \"Xanax, 1,000 pills; Prozac, 200 pills; Ambien 400 pills; Celebrex, a pain reliever, 250 pills; Trexone, similar to morphine, 300 pills; and hydrocodone 9\" were among the drugs found in the hotel room and part of the lethal mix that Jordan allegedly gave her son, according to Bogdanos. Still, Brenner told a spellbound jury that on that fateful day in 2010, Jordan acted out of love and desperation. She had been threatened by her first husband and former business partner, Brenner said. She had accused the man of raiding her bank accounts and defrauding her of millions in profits from their joint businesses. She filed a lawsuit against him in 2012, seeking damages for breach of contract and fraud. \"Gigi knew all the dirty deals,\" Brenner said. \"He knew that Jude was her soft spot.\" Jordan \"believed he was going to kill her, leaving a sexual predator to exercise his paternal rights,\" Brenner told the jury. A lawyer representing her first husband did not returns calls and emails seeking comment. But her first husband filed a lawsuit in August 2013, claiming Jordan defamed him in interviews she gave the media in an effort to advance her defense. Jordan believed that if she died, Jude's biological father -- a yoga instructor and undocumented immigrant who Jordan said she married to help him get a green card -- would get custody, according to Brenner. Jordan first learned that Jude had been sexually abused in December 2007, Brenner said. Jude was autistic and his vocabulary was limited, but in just a few words, he uttered: \"Dad bad, Dad bad, over and over again,\" according to Brenner. That was Jude's way of letting his mother know that he had been victimized repeatedly sexually and physically, Brenner said. \"He had been made to eat feces and subjected to the most degrading conduct imaginable,\" he said. Jude's biological father could not be reached for comment. A relative of the father did not return calls seeking comment. The boy's father has denied the allegations and has never been charged, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. Brenner said Jordan told a therapist about the alleged abuse. The allegations were reported to local authorities, but no action was taken. Jordan then decided to seek the help of a nationally renowned expert on child exploitation in Cheyenne, Wyoming. After being interviewed by him for 30 minutes, Brenner said, Jordan was accused of being unfit and delusional, taken to a medical facility and separated from her son for several months before being reunited with the boy. \"Now she sits here forever brokenhearted, stranded and separated from the true love of her life -- her son,\" Brenner said. Jordan faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted. She is expected to take the stand. Utah mom admits to killing at least six of her babies . Maryland mother accused of suffocating kids, 1 and 3 .

      "52. (CNN) -- Merle and Pat Butler, lifetime residents of Red Bud, Illinois, hold the third winning ticket worth $218 million in last month's Mega Millions lottery, officials announced Wednesday. The retired couple came forward in their hometown's City Hall on Wednesday after spending the past two weeks hiring \"real good financial advisers\" and a lawyer to help them manage their new fortune: $158 million after taxes. \"Instead of thinking of things we could spend it on, we've been thinking of ways to invest it,\" Merle Butler, 65, said Wednesday. Pat Butler, 62, said that keeping their secret was easier because they've been out of town most of the time since they won. \"We were meeting with a lot of people, just not here in town,\" she said . The Butlers are retired computer analysts. \"I was retired, and it looks like I've got another full-time job,\" Merle Butler said. He realized they won as he watched the 10 o'clock news March 30, soon after the drawing. \"The first thing I spotted was I had a mega ball number,\" he said. At least he won something, he thought. \"The further I went, the more they matched,\" he said. But it took time for reality to sink in. \"So, after I looked at it for a couple of minutes, I turned to my wife, who was right there with me, and I says, 'We won,' \" he said. \"And she kind of looked at me funny, and I says, 'No, we won,' and then she started giggling, and she giggled for about four hours, I think.\" The Butlers decided to keep it a secret. \"I figured the quieter I keep it, the better we are to get it set up and get it going before we did the claim,\" Merle Butler said. It may have helped that it was April Fools weekend when he was confronted at the local bank, where he went there to put the ticket in their lock box. \"Oh, I guess you come over to put your ticket away?\" someone at the bank asked them. \"I says, 'Yeah, I won this thing and got to get this thing out away.' I just laughed it off, and she doesn't know until right now that I really had that ticket in there,\" he said. Guessing who held the ticket was the community obsession for the past 18 days in Red Bud, according to Denise Metzger, manager of the Moto Mart convenience store where the winning ticket was sold. Metzger and her staff members used the process of elimination to guess. \"We're watching to figure out who hasn't been coming in,\" she said Tuesday. \"If they got the ticket and are making themselves scarce, that's what we've been paying attention to.\" Mayor Tim Lowry suspected the decision by the winner to have the announcement in his southern Illinois town was evidence it was a Red Bud resident. \"Not knowing who it is, it seems like they want to make a splash in Red Bud,\" Lowry said. Some locals joked on Facebook and the sidewalk that they had the winning ticket. But when Merle Butler spoke, they did not realize he was not joking. \"I answered most of the time truthfully, 'Yes, I did,' but they didn't catch it,\" Merle Butler said. Michigan winner charged with welfare fraud . Red Bud locals commenting on a message board thread threw out several names of suspected winners but never the Butlers. \"Names are just going around, we just need to wait and see when they come forward. Congrats to whoever it was!\" one poster wrote. \"I really don't care who won. I really don't want to know, It wasn't me so I could care less!!!\" said another. \"I just hope it is someone that needs the money,\" another commenter said. Moto Mart, which saw a two-fold rise in lottery ticket sales, also was gossip central for lottery rumors. One rumor floating there is that someone ordered 12 new Camaros from the local Chevrolet dealership, Metzger said. \"That's a big rumor. I had a big laugh about that one.\" The sales manager at Weir Chevrolet Buick GMC shot down that gossip. \"They were Corvettes,\" said Brandon Liefer. \"I'm just messing with you,\" Liefer added, clarifying that he has no clue who the new millionaire might be and they've not ordered new cars. The mayor said the \"windfall of money\" could be a boost for his farming community's economy, but a person \"can only buy so many groceries.\" The Butlers said they would remain in Red Bud, which Merle Butler called \"a nice comfortable, family-oriented community.\" Two other winning tickets were sold for the March 30 drawing that had a record $656 million pre-tax payout. Maryland and Kansas allowed their winners to remain unnamed, but Illinois requires them to come forward. The man and two women who shared ownership of the winning ticket in Maryland are public school employees who are known only as the \"Three Amigos.\" The elementary school teacher, a special education teacher and an administrative worker said they plan to keep their fortune a secret -- and keep working. Metzger and her nine employees at Moto Mart collected their own payoff for selling the winning ticket. Their company gave them $50,000 to share from the $500,000 bonus paid to the store by the Illinois Lottery.\n",
      "53. New York (CNN) -- Former pharmaceutical executive Gigi Jordan at first appeared calm as she described for a New York jury the last time she saw her son alive, those now-fuzzy final moments before she gave the 8-year-old autistic boy a lethal drug concoction. She ordered him food. She may have put on a movie for him. Little Jude Mirra's vocabulary was limited. He typed on a BlackBerry to communicate with her. \"We were typing throughout some period of time. We were saying goodbye to each other,\" Jordan told the Manhattan jury on Thursday during her second-degree murder trial. She began to cry. \"At some point, I put the pills together,\" she recalled. \"I gave him the pills.\" \"Which drugs did you give him more of?\" defense lawyer Allan Brenner asked. \"A lot more of the Ambien,\" she said. \"I gave him more Xanax, but the Ambien is the one I gave him the most of. I gave him Hydrocodone which were large. I was drinking a vodka orange and there was a little left. I broke up the pill and put it into the juice mixed with vodka.\" The chilling details came during Jordan's second day on the stand. The defense team is trying to convince the jury that Jordan was a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill Jude because she felt caught between her two ex-husbands. One ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left Jude with her other ex, his biological father, who she believed had sexually abused the boy. The prosecution has sought to show the jury that the February 2010 killing was premeditated and that Jordan expected to survive. On the stand Thursday, Jordan, a former nurse who made millions in a home heath care company, portrayed her actions as a sort of mercy killing. Her ex-husband was threatening to kill her. \"You're a dead woman,\" she claimed he told her. \"I made the decision I was going to end my life and Jude's life,\" she recalled, placing her hand over her mouth. She said she checked into the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. \"Tell us about your state of mind as you crossed the threshold into the hotel?\" her lawyer asked. \"Numb,\" she responded. \"Defeated. I felt like it was over. Like it was done. There was nothing else I could do.\" Jude and Jordan spent about six hours in the room before she gave him the pills. She said she had the boy wash down the concoction with orange juice and vodka. Jude was knocked out in 15 minutes. \"Were you able to ascertain if Jude was asleep or in a coma?\" Brenner asked. \"Jude was covered with a blanket,\" she said. \"I couldn't tell... I couldn't tell but I assume he had passed.\" Her son breathed rapidly at one point and then stopped. \"At that point, what did you feel and what did you do?\" \"I had a big surge of adrenaline,\" she said. \"My heart started pounding. I grabbed him off the bed and put him on the floor. I was crying and started calling Jude! Jude! Jude! and started doing CPR. I titled his head back, grabbed his nose, gave him two breaths, then gave him 15 compressions. I maybe did this 20 times.\" When Brenner asked why she attempted to revive her son, the judge adjourned the proceedings for the night. On Wednesday, Jordan, fighting back tears, testified that she knowingly gave herself and Jude enough drugs to kill them both. When her trial opened last month, Jordan showed no emotion as a prosecutor described to a jury a \"chilling and horrifying scenario\" in which Jordan allegedly forced the boy to swallow the deadly cocktail. Bruises on the boy's nose, chin and chest indicated that she got on top of him and pressed the poisonous mix of painkillers and anti-inflammatories down his throat with a syringe, the prosecutor alleged. Looking gaunt and pale, Jordan denied that scenario on the stand Wednesday. \"Did you climb on top of Jude and grab his jaw and forcibly put liquid drugs down his throat,\" Brenner asked. \"No,\" Jordan told the jury. \"Did you knowingly give Jude and yourself enough drugs to kill yourself and him?\" \"Yes,\" she responded, tears welling in her eyes. Asked about a history of suicide in her family, Jordan said an aunt killed herself when Jordan was 12 and her mother tried three times. On Wednesday, Jordan also suggested that the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but also by others, including the woman who took Jude to school. She testified that the boy was assaulted by \"a good number of people.\" She testified that one night Jude started screaming, according to Jordan: \" 'Dad bad. Dad bad. Dad bad.' Jude was never able to articulate the word and not clearly like he was screaming at the top of his lungs.\" Jordan testified that she held her son as Jude gestured at his crotch. He pulled Jordan in front of him and whispered, \"Dad, butt. Finger, Finger.' He also kept saying dad, and it was clear he was talking about his dad,\" she told the jury. She testified that the boy had been forced to eat feces and do other \"gruesome and horrible\" things by his biological father. The boy's father has denied the allegations and has not been charged, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. In court, no one has disputed the unthinkable manner in which little Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010. Police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the hotel.

Bogdanos said Jordan \"went to the bank, she transferred $8 million from savings to checking.

The exact time of the boy's death could not be determined, but Jude's body temperature was 80 degrees, suggesting that when police arrived, he had been dead for 8 to 14 hours, Bogdanos said. Brenner has sought to show that Jordan acted out of love and desperation. She had been threatened by her first husband and former business partner, Brenner said.

      "54. (CNN) -- A Georgia man is heading to prison for nearly 10 years for his role in a credit card fraud gang associated with a website called Carder.su that is linked to $50 million in worldwide losses. Cameron Harrison, aka \"Kilobit,\" 28, of Augusta, Georgia, pleaded guilty to possessing more than 260 compromised credit and debit card numbers, which were recovered from his computer and email accounts following his arrest. He also admitted, according to the Department of Justice, that the Carder.su organization committed money laundering, narcotics trafficking and computer crimes. He said members tried to avoid detection by communicating through various encrypted forums, such as chat rooms, private messaging systems and virtual private networks. Harrison was identified when he purchased a counterfeit Georgia driver's license from an undercover special agent through the Carder.su network. During interactions with the undercover special agent, Harrison admitted he had been a vendor of counterfeit identifications in the defunct cyberfraud organization \"ShadowCrew.\" Fifty-five individuals were charged in four separate indictments in Operation Open Market, run by Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Secret Service. To date, 26 individuals have been convicted and the rest are either fugitives or are awaiting trial. Harrison pleaded guilty to participating in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization, conspiracy to engage in a racketeer influenced and corrupt organization, and trafficking in and production of false identification documents. \"This significant sentence is entirely fitting given that this defendant's actions and those of the larger criminal organization harmed countless innocent Americans and seriously compromised our financial system,\" said Homeland Security Investigations Executive Associate Director Peter T. Edge. \"Criminals like this defendant who believe they can elude detection by hiding behind their computer screens here and overseas are discovering that cyberspace affords no refuge from American justice.\"\n",
      "55. (CNN) -- Some court-appointed guardians for incapacitated seniors are not screened before they're appointed, and many are not monitored by the courts after they've taken over the affairs of their charges, resulting in hundreds of allegations of abuse, a federal probe found. An investigation by the Government Accountability Office found allegations of abuse by legal guardians in 45 states and the District of Columbia, according to an advance copy of the report obtained by CNN.  The report is scheduled to be released Wednesday. In 20 cases studied by the office in which criminal or civil penalties resulted, investigators found that guardians stole at least $5.4 million in assets from 158 victims, the report said.  In some instances, these same guardians abused or physically neglected the people they were supposed to help and protect. In six of the 20 cases examined, the courts failed to screen guardians before giving them control over the financial affairs and care of their wards, the federal agency found.  In one case in Missouri, a former taxi driver and convicted bank robber was appointed the legal guardian of a wealthy customer who had no family.  As the elderly man developed Alzheimer's disease, his guardian stole more than $640,000 from him, writing checks out of the victim's estate to pay for exotic dancers and a new Hummer, court records show. In Arizona, an 80-year-old woman's niece was appointed guardian of her wealth and well-being, despite having declared bankruptcy twice and being arrested numerous times for writing bad checks, according to court documents cited in the GAO probe. The elderly woman's attorney had objected to the appointment, saying the two were not close, but the court disregarded the protest.  In the end, the niece misappropriated more than $150,000 from her aunt's estate, court records show. A certified professional guardian failed to visit one of her wards for eight months, according to documents from a case in the state of Washington.  The same guardian was then appointed to oversee another elderly person's estate, despite having $87,000 in tax liens filed against her. Courts failed to oversee the conduct of appointed guardians in 12 of the 20 cases studied in the federal investigation, therefore allowing the abuse and financial exploitation to continue unobserved, sometimes for years, the federal report said. It cited the case of a couple in Kansas who ran an unlicensed group home for mentally ill adults.  The husband became the guardian of a 50-year-old female patient, allowing the couple to steal $250,000 from the woman, court documents show. \"In addition, they forced her and other residents to perform sexual acts for almost two decades as part of the fraudulent therapy treatment that they billed to Medicare, a federal court and jury found,\" according to the federal report. The abuse was discovered when children on a school bus reported seeing naked people working on the farm, the GAO report said. \"At the husband's sentencing, the judge compared conditions at the house to those of a third world prison, and concluded at the wife's sentencing that '...but for the sighting by the children on the school bus, I am firmly convinced that [the group home] would be in business today,'\" the report said. Federal investigators also tested guardian certification required in a handful of states.  To test to see whether this certification process would deter criminal-minded guardians from entering the system, investigators applied for the certification in Illinois, Nevada, New York and North Carolina. None of these states checked the undercover investigators' credit, nor did they validate their Social Security numbers to confirm their identities. The GAO report was requested by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, chaired by Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin.  The committee says its next steps will be to consider federal legislation that will help state court systems improve their training of guardians, judges and legal personnel who handle adult guardianship cases. The committee is also considering legislation that would help reduce fraud by unscrupulous guardians who receive the Social Security and veterans' benefits of incapacitated beneficiaries.\n",
      "56. (CNN) -- The fugitive pilot accused of faking his own death had enough provisions to stay on the run for awhile, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Marcus Schrenker was taken to a hospital after being found Tuesday near Quincy, Florida, authorities say. Authorities found financial manager Marcus Schrenker, who they say  parachuted out of a plane while over Alabama, with deep cuts on his wrist at a campsite near Quincy, Florida Tuesday. But the biggest clues helping authorities piece together his complex plan were what they didn't find at the site of the crashed plane. Authorities believe Schrenker guided himself from his jump-off point to the campsite armed with pages from a 50-state road book. Authorities found the road book, with the Florida and Alabama pages missing, near the downed plane, according to a court affidavit. The financial manager may have mapped out opportunities to hide at campsites. Authorities also found a book of campsites -- also with the Alabama and Florida pages ripped out -- near the plane, according to the affidavit. When authorities found Schrenker Tuesday, he had deep cuts on his wrists. He was incoherent and bleeding so profusely he probably would not have survived another hour, a federal agent said Wednesday. Schrenker was \"verbally resistant\" to authorities' offer of medical help and was muttering a phrase with the word \"die,\" said Frank Chiumento, assistant chief of the U.S. Marshals Service office in Florida, who participated in the raid. But Schrenker also had tools to survive. He had plenty of food, water and clothes, authorities said. Federal charges were filed against Schrenker on Wednesday in the incident, with prosecutors alleging he intentionally communicated a false distress message and caused the Coast Guard \"to attempt to save lives and property when no help was needed.\" Schrenker is also charged with willfully damaging, destroying or wrecking an aircraft. Schrenker was charged Tuesday in Indiana with one felony count each of an unlawful act by a compensated adviser and unlawful transaction by an investment adviser. He was taken to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare and remained there Wednesday, officials said. Indiana officials have agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to have him extradited to Indiana, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Florida. A federal arrest warrant was issued, and Schrenker will appear before a magistrate judge in Pensacola, Florida, after he is released and arrested, the statement said. Chiumento said marshals are waiting for Schrenker to be healthy enough to be released from the hospital before charging him as a fugitive from justice. Authorities say Schrenker took off alone Sunday night from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA-46 en route to Destin, Florida. Over Alabama, he contacted air-traffic controllers, saying the windshield had imploded and that he was bleeding profusely. Court documents indicate Schrenker had planned to say exactly that. On the back of a book found near the crash, there was a list of what appeared to be summary points, \"which included 'cracked windshield, window imploded, bleeding profusely' or words to that effect,\" according to the affidavit. Police suspect he then put the aircraft on autopilot and parachuted to the ground. The plane later crashed near the Blackwater River in East Milton, Florida, missing a group of homes by 50 to 75 yards, said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County, Florida, sheriff's department. Quincy is about 215 miles southeast of Childersburg, Alabama, where Schrenker was first spotted after authorities believe he bailed out of the aircraft.  Watch what authorities believe happened » . Marshals say Schrenker showed up at 2:30 a.m. Monday at a home in Childersburg, about 35 miles south of Birmingham, telling a resident he had been in a canoeing accident. After getting a ride into town, he was taken by police, who were unaware of the crash, to a hotel in nearby Harpersville. When police, who identified Schrenker using his FAA pilot's license, heard about the crash and returned, they found that he had checked in under a false name and had since disappeared, possibly into a nearby wooded area, authorities said. Officials believe he fled Harpersville on a 2008 red Yamaha street bike he had stashed at a storage unit earlier, also using an assumed name. Investigators found the storage unit empty, with some wet clothes left behind. Officials found the motorcycle at the campground Tuesday night. Chiumento declined to reveal how authorities tracked down Schrenker other than to say the lead came from the Birmingham marshal's office. Authorities think Schrenker defrauded investors through three companies he owns before attempting his vanishing act.  Watch what a friend and an attorney say about Schrenker » . A lawyer for Schrenker's wife attempted to distance his family from the incident, saying she and the couple's three young children \"are victims of this man's deceitfulness.\" \"She is not guilty of anything other than trusting her husband of 13 years,\" said attorney Mary Schmid, who is representing Michelle Schrenker in divorce proceedings. Michelle Schrenker contacted her last summer to discuss a divorce because he was having an affair, Schmid said in a statement. \"At the time, she wanted to work on reconciling with her husband,\" Schmid said. But the affair continued, and Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce December 30, the attorney said. The divorce filing was based on Marcus Schrenker's infidelity and not the accusations of investment fraud, the statement said. \"In fact, Michelle first learned of the allegations against him when, on December 31, 2008, the police and investigators came to her door to search her home. To Michelle's dismay, at the time her home was being searched, Marcus was in Florida with his girlfriend.\" \"Everyone should remember that Michelle and her children are suffering through a terrible time right now,\" the statement said. \"Through no fault of their own, they are having to deal with the repercussions of this man's behavior and will be doing so for a long time to come.\" CNN's Brooke Baldwin, Kevin Bohn, Kathleen Johnston and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.\n",
      "57. Editor's note: This is part one of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring from an upcoming, six-hour television event, \"God's Warriors,\" hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross was born to Jewish parents in Ashland, Oregon. A college friend introduced him to Islam. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The path to faith often takes unexpected twists. In the case of Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, the road went through three of the world's major religions -- Judaism, Islam and Christianity -- and ultimately brought him to the FBI. Born to Jewish parents who call themselves mystics, he grew up in what he calls the \"liberal hippie Mecca\" of Ashland, Oregon, a town of about 20,000 near the California border. It was in this ultraliberal intellectual environment that a young Gartenstein-Ross experimented with a radical form of Islam that eventually led him to shun music, reject women's rights and even refuse to touch dogs because he believed this was \"according to God's will.\" \"I began to pray for the mujahedeen, for these stateless warriors who were trying to topple secular governments,\" he said. His journey began in 1997, when as a junior at Wake Forest University, he began to examine his own spiritual identity after experiencing a couple of brushes with death caused by illness. \"That kind of thing can cause spiritual discomfort and make you reevaluate what it is that you're living for,\" he told CNN in an upcoming documentary called \"God's Warriors.\"  Watch behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour » . A college friend introduced him to Islam and he was intrigued by its peaceful message. \"Islam was a very simple faith and as I learned more and more about it, it seemed more and more fascinating to me,\" he said. That fall, he called home to tell his parents he was planning to become a Muslim. \"We felt it was OK,\" his father Moshe Ross said. \"We were glad that he was going to study something and hopefully seriously. And we were happy with Islam.\" When Gartenstein-Ross returned to Ashland, he got his first taste of radicalization when an imam at a local makeshift mosque blasted Western society. \"His argument was that the West was so inherently corrupt, so inherently anti-Islamic, that if we stayed in this society, then inevitably our faith would be eroded,\" said Gartenstein-Ross, who chronicled his experience in a book called \"My Year Inside Radical Islam.\" The humble mosque would soon move to a hilltop headquarters in Ashland, thanks to financial support from a Saudi Arabian charity known as the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, which has since been shut down by U.S. and Saudi authorities for alleged terror ties. Lawyers for Al-Haramain have denied those charges and have filed suit against the U.S. government seeking to have its name cleared. Gartenstein-Ross said a man named Pete Seda, who ran the charity's local office, offered him a job. Seda became his mentor and within a few months Gartenstein-Ross said he found himself agreeing with extreme views. At Al-Haramain, he said he saw the religion which he had embraced for its tolerance become obsessed with rules and ideology. \"What I didn't expect was that over time my ideas would fall into line with theirs,\" he said. \"I wasn't to shake hands with women. I wasn't to pet a dog. I wasn't to wear shorts that came up above my knees. But conversely, my pants legs couldn't be too long.\" But at times, he still had doubts about some beliefs espoused at the mosque. Whenever he questioned the rules, his co-workers would tell him his own views were irrelevant. The view was that \"your moral inclinations do not matter. All that matters is whether this is what's right according to God's will,\" said Gartenstein-Ross. In 1999 he left his job at Al-Haramain for law school at New York University. Away from his co-workers, he was free to question the radical doctrines he'd learned in Oregon and meet with others about spirituality, including Christians. A year later, he converted to Christianity and was eventually baptized in the Baptist church. It was a decision he took extremely seriously because he said his colleagues at Al-Haramain had preached that leaving Islam was punishable by death. \"This conversion out of Islam toward Christianity was certainly not one I took lightly in any way, because I realized there could be repercussions from it,\" he said. The Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation would come up in his life again, but in a very different fashion. His first job after law school was as a clerk with the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. He had to undergo a background check and listed Al-Haramain as a previous employer. Soon, the FBI was quizzing him about the group. Two years later, in 2004, federal agents raided the Ashland offices of Al-Haramain. When he learned of the bust, Gartenstein-Ross says he contacted the FBI. \"I knew about some of Al-Haramain's contempt for U.S. tax law. I knew about the support these guys had for the mujahedeen in Chechnya,\" he said. His mentor, Pete Seda, and another top Al-Haramain official now face conspiracy and tax fraud charges for allegedly helping provide $150,000 in funds meant for Muslim fighters in Chechnya. Lawyers for the group say it renounces terrorism, and in a lawsuit filed against the government last week, Al-Haramain says it's a \"charitable organization that seeks to promote greater understanding of the Islamic religion.\" Seda on Wednesday voluntarily returned to the United States to fight the charges and entered a plea of not guilty. As for Gartenstein-Ross, he is now a counter-terrorism consultant who works with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think-tank formed after September 11, 2001, that lists former FBI director Louis Freeh, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Joseph Lieberman among its \"distinguished advisers.\" He acknowledges his experience is atypical -- that most American Muslims are well-assimilated into American society and don't embrace radical Islamic ideas. \"There is a lot that's going right about Islam in the United States, and a lot of the conversations I've had with moderate Muslims and other Muslims in the past year-and-a-half have been encouraging in terms of what's happening with Islam in America,\" he said.

      "58. Chicago (CNN) -- Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was convicted Monday on 17 of the 20 public corruption charges against him related to his attempt to sell the U.S. Senate seat held by Barack Obama before he resigned to become president. The 11 women and one man reached the verdicts on their 10th day of deliberation in the trial, which began April 20. As the verdicts were read, Blagojevich turned to look back at his wife, Patti, who dropped into her seat. None of the jurors would look at the defendant as the verdicts were being read. He was found guilty of all 10 counts involving wire fraud -- each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The other 10 involved extortion and bribery. Most of the counts have a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The jury acquitted Blagojevich on one count of bribery and was unable to reach verdicts on two counts of attempted extortion. \"I frankly am stunned,\" an uncharacteristically muted Blagojevich told reporters as he left the courtroom hand-in-hand with his wife. \"There's not much left to say, other than we want to get home to our little girls and talk to them and explain things to them and then try to sort things out. I'm sure we'll be seeing you guys again.\" A few minutes later, as he and his wife emerged from an SUV on the street outside his house, he shook hands with a group of well-wishers, some of whom applauded him. \"It's very meaningful to feel the support of the people,\" he told a throng of reporters. \"It's a very meaningful thing. That sadness that I feel and the disappointment and the shock, Patti and I have to discuss this with our children, our little girls, and start planning for the future.\" Their daughters are ages 11 and 14. Chicago-Kent College of Law Professor Richard Kling predicted that Blagojevich would wind up being sentenced to anywhere between six and 11 years. That calculation is reached by a mathematical formula, he said. \"You punch in who he is, what he did,\" he said. After delivering their verdict, the jurors addressed the news media. \"We felt it was very clear he was trying to make a trade for the Senate seat,\" one juror said. Another juror said, \"We'd tried everything to find him not guilty, but the evidence was there.\" The forewoman, a retired director of music and liturgy at a church, said the experience left her with a negative view of politics in general. \"I told my husband that if he was running for politics he'd probably have to find a new wife,\" she said. Blagojevich becomes the second consecutive Illinois governor convicted of corruption. Former Gov. George Ryan is serving time in federal prison. \"We hope that next time anyone who hears any inkling of such activity would come forward to tell us,\" U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald told reporters. \"People should be offended by being shaken down and should come forward and report it to us.\" The current governor, Pat Quinn, called for an ethics initiative in the state. \"Today's conviction only strengthens my resolve to push this effort forward,\" he told reporters. \"I'm very sorry that happened to their family but you have to be accountable for your deeds. Unfortunately, former Gov. Blagojevich committed crimes, according to a jury.\" Last August, after a two-month trial and 14 days of deliberation, another jury deadlocked on 23 of the 24 charges Blagojevich then faced. They found him guilty on one count of lying to FBI investigators, a conviction that could carry a prison sentence of five years. The accusation that Blagojevich tried to profit as he considered whom to appoint to succeed Obama, among other allegations, prompted his impeachment by Illinois' House of Representatives and his removal from office by the state Senate in 2009. Blagojevich was taken into federal custody in December 2008, less than two years into his second term as governor. A federal grand jury indicted in him April 2009. At the time of his arrest, prosecutors said court-authorized wiretaps caught Blagojevich offering Obama's Senate seat in exchange for personal gain, including a job with a nonprofit or union organization, corporate board posts for his wife, campaign contributions or a post in Obama's administration. He expressed frustration, according to prosecutors, that Obama transition officials were \"not willing to give me anything except appreciation.\" \"I've got this thing and it's (expletive) golden, and, uh, uh, I'm just not giving it up for (expletive) nothing. I'm not gonna do it,\" prosecutors quoted Blagojevich as saying. Blagojevich also considered appointing himself to the post, mulling whether he might be better off being indicted as a senator rather than governor, and saying contacts he would make in the federal job would benefit him later, according to prosecutors. Aside from the charges of trying to sell the Senate seat, prosecutors also accused Blagojevich of using his position to obtain financial benefits for himself, his family and his campaign in exchange for jobs, contracts and appointments to state boards to supporters. They accused Blagojevich of accelerating the scheme in 2008 to accumulate funds before a new state ethics law would have limited his ability to raise money from people and companies that were doing business with the state. Along with Blagojevich, prosecutors initially also charged his brother, Robert Blagojevich, with one count of wire fraud, one count of extortion conspiracy, one count of attempted extortion and one count of bribery conspiracy in connection with his brother's alleged Senate-seat-selling plan. But a week after jurors came back from the first trial deadlocked on most of the counts against Rod Blagojevich and all the charges against his brother, prosecutors dropped charges against Robert Blagojevich. Blagojevich's defense argued that he just liked to talk and that he ended up with nothing. The former Cook County, Illinois, assistant prosecutor, state representative and Golden Gloves boxer had remained in the public eye since his removal from office, appearing in a Chicago comedy show, releasing an autobiography, and competing on the TV show \"Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n",
      "59. The Donald Sterling scandal has claimed collateral damage: the president of the NAACP's Los Angeles chapter. Leon Jenkins resigned Thursday, after the civil rights group came under fire for its plans to present a lifetime achievement award to the Los Angeles Clippers owner. Meanwhile on Friday, Sterling's purported girlfriend said through her attorney she was merely a platonic friend, with no sexual relationship with the NBA team owner. Sterling is accused of making racist comments against African-Americans in an audio recording that surfaced last weekend that purportedly depict an argument between Sterling and V. Stiviano. On Friday, Sterling was quoted on DuJour.com as saying \"I wish I had just paid her off\" in reference to Stiviano. The site, which specified that Sterling was referring to Stiviano in a discussion with one of its writers, didn't state when the remark was made. Sterling isn't the only one reeling in the controversy. The uproar also struck one of the nation's leading civil rights groups, the NAACP, whose Los Angeles chapter rescinded Monday its offer to give Sterling a lifetime achievement honor once Sterling's racist remarks came to light. But that reversal was apparently too late. The outcry was too much for the group. \"Please be advised that the legacy, history and reputation of the NAACP is more important to me than the presidency,\" Jenkins said, in announcing his resignation. He said he was stepping down to separate the organization from the \"negative exposure I have caused.\" Group's highest honor . The lifetime achievement award is the NAACP's highest honor. The L.A. chapter presented Sterling with the award in 2009, and was planning to do so again this month. Sterling had donated a substantial amount of money to the chapter in the last few years. Some reports put it around $45,000. Earlier this week, the NBA's commissioner came down hard on Sterling, ordering him out of his team's business and pushing to force him to sell over the remarks that caused a firestorm since becoming public last weekend. The inflammatory sentiments came packaged in a 10-minute recording that TMZ said occurred during an April 9 conversation between Sterling and girlfriend Stiviano. On the recording, a man and woman argue about photos posted to Instagram in which she appears with African-Americans. The man says he doesn't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her. The sports website Deadspin posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording. 'Giving away integrity' The NAACP and Sterling weren't strangers, and the group had honored Donald Sterling before, an analyst said. \"The first time Sterling was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the group was in the midst of a lawsuit for housing discrimination based upon race,\" said LZ Granderson, a CNN contributor and lecturer at Northwestern University. \"To decide to honor him with the award a second time, after he had paid millions to settle multiple discrimination suits ... is not selling out. Selling out makes financial sense. No, considering what $45,000 means to a man of Sterling's wealth, honoring him with awards is just giving integrity away.\" The billionaire real estate mogul has found himself in hot water in the past, denying in court accusations of discrimination tied to the NBA team and to property he owns. A 'social price' to pay . Soon after the scandal broke, Jenkins didn't seem inclined to cut ties with Sterling. \"At some point when there has been proof, I think that would be a legitimate time for the NAACP to sit down with Sterling and try to work out how and why he did what he did and what is he going to do in the future,\" he said. \"God teaches us to forgive. And the way I look at it, after a sustained period of just proof to the African-American community that those words don't really reflect his heart, I think there's room for forgiveness.\" By Monday, Jenkins had changed course. \"The revelation that Mr. Sterling may have made comments in a phone conversation that were reminiscent of an ugly time period in American history that contained elements of segregation and racial discrimination demands that the Los Angles NAACP intention to honor Mr. Sterling for his lifetime body of work must be withdrawn, and his donation to the Los Angeles NAACP returned,\" the group said Monday when it withdrew its invitation. \"There is a personal, economic and social price that Mr. Sterling must pay for his attempt to turn the clock back on race relations.\" 'Girlfriend' says she was just a pal . On Friday, Stiviano's lawyer said his client wasn't Sterling's girlfriend. Rather, Stiviano was a platonic friend, said attorney Mac E. Nehoray. \"My client was not Donald Sterling's mistress or girlfriend. We have proof that there was no sexual relationship,\" Nehoray said. \"They were more like friends.  Platonic.\" When asked why gave Sterling her such lavish gifts as expensive cars, the attorney said: \"Because he cares about her.\" Nehoray also stated that Stiviano didn't distribute the recorded conservation. \"She did not leak the recordings,\" the attorney said. \"We are narrowing down who might have leaked the tapes, but we do not want to divulge at this point.\" Stiviano doesn't have a book deal connected to the Sterling controversy, Nehoray said. \"There is no book deal. She's been writing a book, but not about Sterling. It's about her life,\" Nehoray said. Stiviano used to work in a crime victims unit in a district attorney's office, Nehoray added. \"When the truth comes out, whoever has been calling her 'gold digger' and 'con artist' will have to retract that -- absolutely false,\" Nehoray said. In March, Sterling's wife sued Stiviano, accusing her having an affair with the billionaire team owner. In the lawsuit, Rochelle Sterling accuses Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. The suit claims that Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. Stiviano also took over a $1.8 million duplex through fraud and received about $250,000 in cash from Sterling, the court document claims. Stiviano fought back, saying in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts. She also said she never took advantage of the Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Sterling no stranger to lawsuits . This isn't the first time the Sterlings have been involved in a lawsuit. Elgin Baylor, who was executive vice president and general manager of the Clippers from 1986 to 2008, filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination against Sterling in 2009, saying that the team's owner underpaid him and treated him \"as a token because of his race.\" Sterling denied those accusations and said the team acted within its rights and \"for good cause and not for any improper reason.\" Before the case went to trial, Baylor dropped the racial discrimination claim but maintained accusations of age discrimination. A jury sided with Sterling in 2011. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in 2006 accusing Sterling's rental company of refusing to lease Beverly Hills apartments to African-Americans, refusing to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown section of Los Angeles County and turning away families with children from its properties. That case was settled in 2009, with Sterling agreeing to pay nearly $3 million but continuing to deny the accusations. Then there was a 2003 lawsuit in which the nonprofit Housing Rights Center and a group of tenants who lived in Sterling's properties accused him of \"numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices,\" according to court documents. Among other claims, his accusers said Sterling told building staff that he did not like Hispanic or African-American tenants and that he preferred Korean-American tenants and made \"disparaging comments\" about African-American and Hispanic tenants. Sterling, according to court documents, \"vehemently denied\" the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of \"being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas.\" The case was dismissed in 2005 after a settlement was reached. Details of the deal were not disclosed. One of his former tenants, Darryl Williams, videotaped Sterling's wife going door-to-door at the building. Over a decade later, Williams says he's still mystified about what happened and about Sterling himself. \"We rent his buildings, support his basketball team, play on his teams,\" said Williams, who is African-American. \"But he's oblivious to that. As far as he's concerned, he's like a plantation owner.\"\n",
      "60. Former pharmaceutical executive Gigi Jordan testified that she knowingly gave a lethal concoction of drugs to her 8-year-old autistic son. Fighting back tears as she took the stand for the first time in her second-degree murder trial, Jordan said Wednesday that she knowingly gave herself and her son, Jude Mirra, enough drugs to kill them both. The prosecution, meanwhile, contends the killing was premeditated and Jordan expected to survive. When her Manhattan trial opened last month, Jordan showed no emotion as a prosecutor described to a jury a \"chilling and horrifying scenario\" in which Jordan allegedly forced the autistic boy to swallow a deadly drug cocktail. Bruises on the boy's nose, chin and chest indicated that she got on top of him and pressed the poisonous mix of painkillers and anti-inflammatories down his throat with a syringe, the prosecutor alleged. Looking gaunt and pale, Jordan denied that scenario on the stand Wednesday. \"Did you climb on top of Jude and grab his jaw and forcibly put liquid drugs down his throat,\" defense lawyer Allan Brenner asked. \"No,\" Jordan told the jury. \"Did you knowingly give Jude and yourself enough drugs to kill yourself and him?\" \"Yes,\" she responded, tears welling in her eyes. Asked about a history of suicide in her family, Jordan said an aunt killed herself when Jordan was 12 and her mother tried three times. Brenner and the defense team are trying to convince the jury that Jordan was a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill Jude by her two former husbands: One who had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left the boy with his biological father, who she believed had sexually abused Jude. On the stand Wednesday, Jordan, a former nurse who made millions in a home heath care company, also suggested that the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but by her first husband and his wife as well as the woman who took Jude to school. She testified that the boy was assaulted by \"a good number of people.\" Jude was autistic and his vocabulary was limited, but one night he started screaming, according to Jordan: \" 'Dad bad. Dad bad. Dad bad.' Jude was never able to articulate the word and not clearly like he was screaming at the top of his lungs.\" Jordan testified that she held her son as Jude gestured at his crotch. He pulled Jordan in front of him and whispered, \"Dad, butt. Finger, Finger.' He also kept saying dad, and it was clear he was talking about his dad,\" she told the jury. She testified that the boy had been forced to eat feces and do other \"gruesome and horrible\" things by his biological father. The boy's father has denied the allegations and has never been charged, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. In court, no one has disputed the unthinkable manner in which little Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010. Police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. The call to police came after a relative of Jordan was unable to reach her. At an autopsy, four of the painkillers and anti-inflammatories used to kill Jude were recovered undigested from his stomach, prosecutors said. Orange juice and vodka were used to wash down the drugs. \"His fate was sealed,\" assistant district attorney Matt Bogdanos said in opening statements. \"He didn't die fast. One by one, his vital organs shut down. It didn't take minutes. It took hours to die.\" While Jude lay dying, Bogdanos said, Jordan sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account. Brenner said Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt. The prosecution sought to show the jury that the killing was premeditated and that Jordan expected to survive. Bogdanos said Jordan \"went to the bank, she transferred $8 million from savings to checking. She checked in (at the hotel) without a reservation and paid cash.\" The exact time of the boy's death could not be determined, but Jude's body temperature was 80 degrees, suggesting that when police arrived, he had been dead for 8 to 14 hours, Bogdanos said. Police found a variety of drugs, which the prosecutor enumerated for the jury: \"Xanax, 1,000 pills; Prozac, 200 pills; Ambien 400 pills; Celebrex, a pain reliever, 250 pills; Trexone, similar to morphine, 300 pills; and hydrocodone.\" These were among the drugs found in the hotel room and part of the lethal mix that Jordan allegedly gave her son, according to Bogdanos. But Brenner has sought to show that Jordan acted out of love and desperation. She had been threatened by her first husband and former business partner, Brenner said. She had accused the man of raiding her bank accounts and defrauding her of millions in profits from their joint businesses. She filed a lawsuit against him in 2012, seeking damages for breach of contract and fraud. Defendant Gigi Jordan \"knew all the dirty deals,\" Brenner said. Her first husband \"knew that Jude was her soft spot.\" Jordan \"believed he was going to kill her, leaving a sexual predator to exercise his paternal rights,\" Brenner told the jury. Her first husband filed a lawsuit in August 2013, claiming Jordan defamed him in interviews she gave the media in an effort to advance her defense. Jordan believed that if she died, Jude's biological father, a yoga instructor, would have gained custody, according to Brenner. Brenner said Jordan told a therapist and local authorities about the alleged abuse but no action was taken. Jordan then decided to seek the help of a nationally renowned expert on child exploitation in Cheyenne, Wyoming. After being interviewed by him for 30 minutes, Brenner said, Jordan was accused of being unfit and delusional, taken to a medical facility and separated from her son for several months before being reunited with the boy. Jordan faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.\n",
      "61. In further proof that seemingly nothing can bring Silvio Berlusconi down -- not even a potential jail sentence -- Italy's most colorful public figure is back in contention to lead his country for a fourth time. Another spell in Italy's highest office would be just the latest chapter in the life of the charming, billionaire three-time former prime minister. In October Berlusconi was sentenced to four years in prison for tax evasion, but has since appealed the verdict. Until recently, Berlusconi appeared to be leading a charmed life. His vast business empire spanned media, construction and football, making him the 118th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $6.2 billion, and he was Italy's longest-serving post-war prime minister before quitting in 2011. But last year he became embroiled in charges that he had paid for sex with a 17-year-old girl; his coalition government became ever more fragile; and Berlusconi resigned his premiership as Europe's financial crisis threatened to embroil Italy. Despite the many scandals that have dogged Berlusconi since he entered politics nearly two decades ago, the 76-year-old is indisputably one of life's survivors. In Parliament, opponents tabled 51 confidence votes in him in the past three years alone, but Italians have thrice elected him as prime minister. In this election Berlusconi is appealing to tax-burdened Italians' desire for some relief. He has promised not only to abolish the hugely unpopular property tax on primary residences, known as the IMU, he is also promising to pay back the property taxes people have already paid. Berlusconi is also vowing to cut corporate taxes and income taxes and spend the economy out of the recession. However his promises have met with considerable skepticism. Prominent journalist Gad Lerner has long been critical of the former prime minister. \"Berlusconi has transformed Italian politics into a big show and he is always looking for a spectacular center for his propaganda.\" Businessman Gianvencenzo Coppi traveled to Rome to hear center-left rival, Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, talk about his commitment to the private sector, but he told CNN he hadn't made up his mind whom he would vote for, but it was unlikely to be Berlusconi. \"He's making promises in my opinion he cannot maintain,\" said Coppi. \"He's promising to cut taxes, the IMU ... and no one knows in which way he can do it.\" Cruise ship crooner . Born in Milan in 1936, Berlusconi gave notice early on of his showman side by working as a lounge room crooner aboard a cruise ship to help fund his university tuition -- he studied law. Various low-level commercial enterprises followed before the fledgling entrepreneur enjoyed his first real success in property development in the late 1960s when he was involved in a project to build Milano Two -- nearly 4,000 flats -- outside Milan. After amassing a fortune from his property portfolio in the 1970s, he diversified his interests by setting up a TV cable company, Telemilano, and buying two other cable channels in an effort to break the national TV monopoly in Italy. In 1978, these channels were incorporated into his newly formed Fininvest group, which included department stores, insurance companies and even AC Milan -- one of the world's biggest football clubs. Berlusconi turned his attention to politics in 1993 when he formed the center-right Forza Italia Party and the following year, in a snap election, he won the post of prime minister. However, a dispute with his right-wing coalition partners from the Northern League Party, as well as an indictment for alleged tax fraud, ended Berlusconi's tenure in the job after barely seven months. He was acquitted on appeal in 2000 after the statute of limitations had expired. After defeat in the 1996 election to his political nemesis, Romano Prodi, he became embroiled in other financial scandals, including a charge of bribing tax inspectors. He denied any wrongdoing and was cleared again on appeal in 2000. His fortunes turned again in 2001 when he was sworn in as prime minister for a second time. But Prodi -- a former European Commission president -- ended Berlusconi's more successful reign with his center-left Union coalition victory in 2006. At that time, the tycoon had presided over the longest-serving post-war Italian government. Return to power . Despite having a pacemaker implanted to regulate his heartbeat after he collapsed during a political rally, he refused to slow down. Sporting a hair transplant, cosmetic surgery and a tan, Berlusconi returned to power for a third time in 2008 under the banner of the newly created People of Freedom party. The next year proved to be one of extremes for the veteran politician. He was praised for his handling of the devastating earthquake that struck the Italian town of L'Aquila in April 2009, and survived criticism after urging survivors to see their plight like \"a weekend of camping.\" But the following month, Berlusconi's second wife, Veronica Lario, filed for divorce -- alleging Berlusconi had an inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old aspiring model whose birthday party he had attended. Berlusconi said she was the daughter of a friend and that he had done nothing wrong. In December that year, a man with a history of mental illness hit Berlusconi in the face with a replica of Milan's cathedral at a campaign rally, breaking several of his teeth and fracturing his nose. Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that the irrepressible Berlusconi continued to shake hands with supporters for \"a couple of minutes\" after being hit. With the country's economy reeling amid the financial crisis, pressure on Berlusconi grew. Gianfranco Fini -- a former party ally -- lashed out, accusing him of a lack of attention to the economy and structural reforms that Italy needs. The prime minister survived three votes of confidence in Parliament during 2010 and 2011, winning one by just three votes, but his authority continued to ebb. Economists said Berlusconi commanded neither sufficient political authority to push through spending cuts nor the moral high ground to squeeze more taxes out of Italians while he faced trial on various charges. Other European leaders criticized him for failing to implement economic reform with sufficient urgency. Bunga bunga charges . Meanwhile, Berlusconi faced a serious personal challenge with charges of sex with an underage nightclub dancer and abuse of power. Q&A: Silvio Berlusconi's legal woes . Berlusconi had sex 13 times with underage dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed \"Ruby the heart-stealer,\" say prosecutors who allege the prime minister abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft. El Mahroug has said she never had sex with Berlusconi and that she lied to him about her age, telling him she was 24. In September 2011, prosecutors submitted transcripts of approximately 100,000 pages of wiretaps -- from 2008 and 2009 -- to a court in Bari. The prosecutors have accused eight people of paying young women to attend so-called \"bunga bunga\" parties at Berlusconi's home. Berlusconi denied the charges and accused prosecutors of conspiring against him in a left-wing plot. \"Communism never changes in Italy. There are still people who use the penal code as a weapon in their ideological battles,\" he said earlier this year. But, according to the transcripts of the calls, Berlusconi made several controversial remarks, vowing at one point to leave Italy, which he described as a \"s****y country\" that \"sickened\" him. When confronted with these remarks, Berlusconi laughed off this and other gaffes.\n",
      "62. (CNN) -- In life, Aaron Swartz was a force in creating today's Web, helping write game-changing code in his early teens before turning his attentions to Internet activism. In death, an apparent suicide that came as he faced federal charges that could have sent him to prison for decades, he became a martyr of sorts -- a champion for a new generation of believers that the Web, and the information on it, deserve to be free. Now, his story is the subject of a documentary film being released Friday. \"The Internet's Own Boy\" is a look at Swartz's life and untimely death at age 26. For director Brian Knappenberger, it's a tale that merges a captivating life story with a look at some of the most important legal, social and ethical issues of the digital age. \"On the one hand, it was a very compelling personal story that was just, by itself, inspirational and interesting but, ultimately tragic,\" said Knappenberger. \"Then there's this kind of sharp combination with the issues Aaron was involved in, which are really, really relevant for our time. \"I wanted to tell this personal, ultimately tragic, story that also touches on a broken criminal justice system, outdated computer laws\" and other issues, he said in a phone interview. 'Digital savant and wise elder' Swartz was a digital prodigy who helped craft the Internet we know today. By age 14, he had co-written the specifications for RSS -- a Web-publishing system for delivering content from frequently updated sites like blogs. As a teen, he was one of the architects of Creative Commons, writing code for the nonprofit devoted to letting creators make their works available for others to share and improve upon. At 19, after a single year at Stanford, he formed his own company, Infogami, which would merge with, and help create, Reddit -- the vast, freewheeling social-sharing site built on the foundation of free-expression and online anonymity. \"World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down,\" said World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee, in a tweet about the death of a man 31 years his junior. 'A legal nightmare' On January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested by police officers from MIT and charged with breaking and entering for downloading more than 4 million documents from a campus digital library. Federal prosecutors tacked on wire fraud, computer fraud and other charges. In all, Swartz faced up to 35 years in prison and a $1 million fine if convicted. Supporters note that none of the documents he acquired included sensitive personal data or would have netted Swartz any financial gain. JSTOR, the digital library from which the documents came, declined to press charges and asked prosecutors to drop the case. Two years later Swartz was found hanged to death in his Brooklyn apartment, just two days after prosecutors had turned down his lawyer's second plea-bargain offer. \"He certainly was the kind of person who carried the weight of the world on his shoulders,\" Knappenberger said. \"While he was rousing the troops for this political cause, he was also going through this kind of personal hell.\" His film notes that friends described depression-like symptoms in Swartz and that he suffered from ulcerative colitis, a painful intestinal condition similar to the one suffered by Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain, who killed himself in 1994. But Knappenberger feels it was the legal ordeal that pushed Swartz to his final desperate moments. \"I think it was the two-year legal nightmare that left him exhausted, emotionally and mentally,\" he said. \"I don't let the case off that easily. I think that, without this, we'd still have him.\" 'A beautifully crafted film' \"The Internet's Own Boy\" was funded in part through a Kickstarter campaign and screened earlier this year at the Sundance and South by Southwest film festivals, where it got largely positive reviews. \"While the film borders on hagiography ... the celebration of what Swartz accomplished never feels forced or inauthentic,\" wrote Geoff Berkshire in Variety. \"Instead, 'The Internet's Own Boy' is a beautifully crafted film that opens a window on a world not everyone has entered yet, and exposes ways in which both the legal system and the U.S. government is lagging hopelessly behind technology.\" Katherine Kilkenny, writing for IndieWire, said one of the film's running themes is the question of whether \"this generation's programming magicians\" will choose to use their power for purpose or profit. \"We often see stories of slight, sloppy-looking young coders like Swartz transformed into national icons by the tech industry, but rarely with such close attention to ethics,\" she wrote. \"Knappenberger has delivered a film brimming with outrage.\" It's that sort of outrage that turned Swartz's death into a cause celebre among Internet-freedom advocates. Tributes after death . Multiple memorials were held for Swartz, from his hometown of Highland Park, Illinois, to Cooper Union in Manhattan to Capitol Hill, where attendees included U.S. senators and representatives who spoke out in favor of the freedom of information online. An online movement tagged #PDFtribute encouraged academics and others in the public sector to make their writings and other documents freely available online, and many did. Princeton University announced new scholarships in Swartz's name. He was posthumously named to the Internet Hall of Fame, and members of the \"hacktivist\" movement Anonymous hacked two MIT websites, posting calls that Swartz's death become a rallying point for the open-access movement. \"That was part of the reason I was so drawn to it,\" said Knappenberger, who had previously profiled Anonymous in the documentary \"We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists.\" \"There was obviously this big wave of anger and frustration and sympathy that came out of the Internet after he died that was notably not there during his case. \"It wasn't just people who knew him. It was people from far beyond the online world where he was a celebrity. All kinds of people really responded to his story.\" To those closest to him, the film is a bittersweet tribute. \"It's extremely difficult for me to watch,\" Aaron's father, Robert Swartz, told CNN. \"I think that Brian has done a wonderful job presenting who Aaron was, where he came from, what he tried to accomplish, and what kind of role model he represents to others who can use those skills rather than simply making money as a means to improve the world and make the world a better place.\" \"The Internet's Own Boy\" premiered Thursday in Los Angeles and begins rolling out to theaters in more than 25 cities on Friday. It is being released simultaneously in multiple digital formats, including on Creative Commons, where it will be made available for any use that does not involve making a profit from it.

      "63. (CNN) -- A now-retracted British study that linked autism to childhood vaccines is an \"elaborate fraud,\" according to a medical journal -- a charge the physician behind the study vigorously denies. The British medical journal BMJ, which published the results of its investigation, concluded Dr. Andrew Wakefield misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the 1998 study -- and that there was \"no doubt\" Wakefield was responsible. The journalist who wrote the BMJ articles said Thursday he believes Wakefield should face criminal charges. However, Wakefield said his work has been \"grossly distorted.\" Speaking on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360,\" he said Wednesday he is the target of \"a ruthless, pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns.\" The medical publication says the study has done long-lasting damage to public health. Read autism coverage on \"The Chart\" blog. \"It's one thing to have a bad study, a study full of error, and for the authors then to admit that they made errors,\" Fiona Godlee, BMJ's editor-in-chief, told CNN. \"But in this case, we have a very different picture of what seems to be a deliberate attempt to create an impression that there was a link by falsifying the data.\" Britain stripped Wakefield of his medical license in May. What causes autism? \"Meanwhile, the damage to public health continues, fueled by unbalanced media reporting and an ineffective response from government, researchers, journals and the medical profession,\" BMJ states in an editorial accompanying the work. Wakefield dismissed Brian Deer, the writer of the British Medical Journal articles, as \"a hit man who has been brought in to take me down\" by pharmaceutical interests. Deer has signed a disclosure form stating that he has no financial interest in the business. On CNN's \"American Morning\" Thursday, Deer did not deny he was paid by the BMJ. \"I was commissioned by BMJ to write the piece,\" he said. \"That's what journalists do.\" He said he is also paid by the Sunday Times of London, where he has been employed since the early 1980s. \"I was being paid as a journalist,\" he told CNN's Kiran Chetry. \"Like you are. You're being paid to do your job.\" \"The point you have to remember about all this, firstly, it's not me saying this. It's the editors of the BMJ,\" Deer said. \"... Secondly, this material has been published in the United Kingdom in extraordinary detail. If it is true that Andrew Wakefield is not guilty as charged, he has the remedy of bringing a libel action against myself, the Sunday Times of London, against the medical journal here, and he would be the richest man in America.\" He said Wakefield's remarks amount to a smear campaign against him, noting that Wakefield has previously sued him and lost. The autism assignment was a \"routine assignment\" given to him in 2003, he said, adding that he expected it to be finished in a week or two. However, \"when you're a journalist and you see that somebody you're dealing with is lying to you,\" it must be pursued, he said. Wakefield, he said, is attempting to \"cloud the picture... Some people say he's a liar and he says I'm a liar. What he's basically trying to do is split the difference.\" Allegations that he is in collusion with the pharmaceutical industry are \"another one of Andrew Wakefield's concoctions,\" Deer said. \"He knows it's not true.\" Asked whether he thinks Wakefield should face criminal charges, Deer said, \"I personally do.\" In addition, he said the Department of Homeland Security should take a close look at Wakefield's visa application and how he got into the United States, \"how he's been able to export his mischief.\" Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association, defended Wakefield in a CNN interview. \"I cannot imagine for a second that Dr. Wakefield would have any reason to falsify data,\" she said. \"He's a man of integrity and honesty and truly wants to find the answers for millions of children who have been affected by autism.\" Fournier accused pharmaceutical companies of trying to protect their turf. \"You can't question vaccines without being destroyed,\" she said. \"There's too much money at stake here.\" J.B. Handley, the father of an 8-year-old with autism and a co-founder of Generation Rescue -- a group that believes there's a connection between autism and vaccinations -- also questioned the motivation behind the investigation into Wakefield's work. \"Children are given 36 vaccines in the U.S. by the time they reach the age of five,\" he said. \"This is an attempt to whitewash, once and for all, the notion that vaccines cause autism.\" The now-discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccination rates dropped sharply in Britain after its publication, falling as low as 80% by 2004. Measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years. In the United States, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the CDC reported. \"But perhaps as important as the scare's effect on infectious disease is the energy, emotion and money that have been diverted away from efforts to understand the real causes of autism and how to help children and families who live with it,\" the BMJ editorial states. Wakefield has been unable to reproduce his results in the face of criticism, and other researchers have been unable to match them. Most of his co-authors withdrew their names from the study in 2004 after learning he had had been paid by a law firm that intended to sue vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose. After years of controversy, the Lancet, the prestigious journal that originally published the research, retracted Wakefield's paper last February. Actress Jenny McCarthy, founder of Generation Rescue and whose son also has autism, declined to comment on Wednesday's developments, but has previously supported Wakefield. \"It is our most sincere belief that Dr. Wakefield and parents of children with autism around the world are being subjected to a remarkable media campaign engineered by vaccine manufacturers reporting on the retraction,\" she said after the Lancet retraction. Deer said Wakefield \"chiseled\" the data before him, \"falsifying medical histories of children and essentially concocting a picture, which was the picture he was contracted to find by lawyers hoping to sue vaccine manufacturers and to create a vaccine scare.\" According to BMJ, Wakefield received more than 435,000 pounds ($674,000) from the lawyers. Godlee, the journal's editor-in-chief, said the study shows that of the 12 cases Wakefield examined in his paper, five showed developmental problems before receiving the MMR vaccine and three never had autism. \"It's always hard to explain fraud and where it affects people to lie in science,\" Godlee said. \"But it does seem a financial motive was underlying this, both in terms of payments by lawyers and through legal aid grants that he received but also through financial schemes that he hoped would benefit him through diagnostic and other tests for autism and MMR-related issues.\" But Wakefield told CNN that claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism \"came from the parents, not me,\" and that his paper had \"nothing to do with the litigation.\" \"These children were seen on the basis of their clinical symptoms, for their clinical need, and they were seen by expert clinicians and their disease diagnosed by them, not by me,\" he said. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, said the reporting \"represents Wakefield as a person where the ends justified the means.\" But he said the latest news may have little effect on those families who still blame vaccines for their children's conditions. \"Unfortunately, his core group of supporters is not going to let the facts dissuade their beliefs that MMR causes autism,\" Wiznitzer said. \"They need to be open-minded and examine the information as everybody else.\" Wakefield's defenders include David Kirby, a journalist who has written extensively on autism. He told CNN that Wakefield not only has denied falsifying data, he has said he had no way to do so. \"I have known him for a number of years. He does not strike me as a charlatan or a liar,\" Kirby said. If the BMJ allegations are true, then Wakefield \"did a terrible thing\" -- but he added, \"I personally find it hard to believe that he did that.\" CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Miriam Falco and Ed Payne contributed to this report.\n",

      "65. By . Hugo Duncan . Last updated at 3:35 AM on 19th August 2011 . The stock market suffered its biggest collapse in three years yesterday as the global economy plunged deeper into crisis, wiping billions off the value of Britain's leading companies. Every blue-chip firm listed in London fell in the worst single day of trading since the dark days of 2008 when investment bank Lehman Brothers imploded. As analysts spoke of 'a tidal wave of selling', the FTSE 100 index fell 239.37 points to 5092.23 – a drop in value of £62.3billion. Plummeting: The FTSE crashed by 5 per cent today against a backdrop of the euro zone crisis and damaging U.S. unemployment figures . Elsewhere, the German stock market . fell 5.8 per cent, Paris dropped 5.5 per cent and the Dow Jones . Industrial  Average dropped 3.9 per cent in  New York. The Lehman debacle tipped the global . economy into recession – and fears are mounting that the developed world . is on the brink of another devastating downturn. One reason for the panic was the . revelation that a lender in the eurozone was forced to go cap in hand to . the European Central Bank for £300million in emergency funding. Analysts said the 'worrying' development showed banks are too nervous to lend to each other – just as . they were at the height of the financial crisis. Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley . warned yesterday that the United States and the eurozone are 'hovering . dangerously close to recession'. Despair may have engulfed the markets, but one British entrepreneur found himself £300million richer yesterday. Dr Mike Lynch, the son of an Essex fireman, saw his software firm Autonomy sold to U.S. giant Hewlett-Packard for £7billion. The deal values his 8.1 per cent stake in the FTSE 100 firm at £567million. It was worth just under £284million before the takeover bid was announced. It is an extraordinary success for Dr Lynch, who began work on the firm when he was writing his post-doctoral thesis at Cambridge University on 18th century theologian Thomas Bayes, who tried to prove the existence of God through mathematics. Autonomy now has more than 16,000 clients worldwide including Nasa, Procter & Gamble, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The technology Dr Lynch developed allows computers to analyse data across a range of media, making it useful for tracking down fraud or even searching for terrorists. Investors are also increasingly . concerned about the health of the banking system in Europe as the . debt-crisis crippling the single currency bloc rumbles on. Officials at the Bank of England said the exaggerated sense of fear in the markets may be holding back the recovery. The man who became a hate figure to . many in Britain for designing the modern European Union yesterday . admitted that it was now 'on the edge of the precipice'. Jacques Delors, 86, a federalist . Frenchman, used his time as European Commission chief in the 1980s to . expand its power over national governments and pave the way for the . single European currency. Will Hedden, at IG Index in London, said: 'Panic selling accelerated in the biggest losing day yet of this summer sell-off. 'The fear factor has reached boiling . point. Banking stocks have been decimated across Europe, with . indiscriminate selling even in banks that maintain that their exposure . to the crisis is slim. 'No sector is surviving this tidal wave of selling.' Damaging confidence: Analysts say German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to bail out debt-ridden eurozone members would disproportionately hit the UK . The financial markets have been rocked . by a crisis of leadership in recent weeks as politicians on both sides . of the Atlantic failed to come up with policies to tackle debts and . promote growth. The FTSE 100 index has lost 1,000 points, or £260billion of its value, since its 2011 peak in February. Dark days: Today's jobless figures have done nothing for Barack Obama's domestic standing . The majority of the slump has taken place this month in one of the most bruising episodes in stock market history. It has hit the value of retirement . pots for millions and left investors across the country nursing heavy . losses. UK bank shares were the worst hit in London yesterday with . taxpayer-supported Royal Bank of Scotland down 11.3 per cent and Lloyds . Banking Group down 9.3 per cent. The shares are worth less than half . what they were when the Government bailed the banks out – meaning UK . taxpayers are sitting on losses of £34.5billion in the two companies. The European banking sector has lost . 30 per cent of its value this year. French banks were back in the firing . line yesterday with Societe Generale down 11.6 per cent. It came after . the ECB provided more than £300million of emergency funds to an unnamed . lender – the first such loan since February. 'This shows that the situation has escalated,' said Citigroup analyst Juergen Michels. Morgan Stanley cut its global growth . forecasts for this year from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent and for 2012 . from 4.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent. 'The path now looks even more bumpy, . below-par and brittle than previously thought,' said Joachim Fels, who . co-heads Morgan Stanley's global economic team. He said the main reason for the . downturn was the failure of politicians and regulators in Washington and . Europe to tackle the sovereign debt crisis crippling the world economy. Hundreds of thousands of families in . the UK are over-indebted and 'vulnerable' if financial conditions get . worse, a senior Bank of England director said last night. Andrew Haldane, the Bank's executive . director in charge of ensuring financial stability, said one in 14 . British households is in negative equity. ANALYSIS by RUTH SUTHERLAND, Associate City Editor . 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself': President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Banking Bill at the White House in 1933 . During his inaugural address in 1933, newly elected U.S. President . Franklin D. Roosevelt famously told the American people: 'The only thing . we have to fear is fear itself.' Today, the world is clouded with economic and political uncertainty just . as it was in the dark days following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and . the Great Depression. As people are forced to watch impotently as stock markets lurch once . again into turmoil, wiping billions of pounds off the value of their . savings and pensions, it is understandable that many are riven with . anxiety. Fear is stalking the trading floors and it is contagious, casting an ominous shadow over all of our lives. But the question is whether the extreme reactions we have seen on the stock markets over the past few weeks are justified. As Andrew Haldane, a senior director at the Bank of England, pointed out yesterday, the fear factor is rampant on the markets. Not all of it is rational, and these waves of terror engulfing the stock exchanges are actually making matters worse. During the boom, traders were swept along by a wave of euphoria and . loaded themselves with risks that proved to be wildly over-optimistic. Haldane now believes the markets may have switched to the opposite pole, . with traders abnormally reluctant to take  risks because the . psychological scarring from the losses of the last meltdown is still . fresh and painful. That exaggerated fear of risk – equally irrational as the mindless . exuberance of the boom years – is in itself a brake on economic . recovery. When stock markets plunge, companies become reluctant to expand or . invest. Consumers cut down on their spending and stay out of the shops. Instead of applying our energy to creating growth, building new . businesses and embarking on new ventures, firms and individuals retreat . into a paralysing state of gloom and timidity. With markets in the paranoid state of the past few weeks, even minor or . quite predictable pieces of news can produce enormous swings on the . trading screens. No-one should underestimate the power of herd-behaviour . on the markets, which are driven by the opposing forces of greed and . fear. Driven by greed and fear: A man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London. A Cambridge study found hormone levels significantly affected traders' behaviour . Cambridge University researchers even found in a study of saliva from . City workers that hormonal activity among young male traders magnified . the booms and busts. They discovered that when dealers hit a winning streak their . testosterone levels soared, making them overconfident and intoxicated . with their own success. But when markets dipped, the researchers saw a rise in the stress . hormone cortisol, which made the dealers shy of risk and magnified the . downward slide in markets. But there are some very good reasons to be fearful. The banking crisis . that caused the market meltdown in 2008 has transformed itself into a . sovereign debt crisis. Question marks now hover over the indebtedness not only of smaller . nations such as Greece and Portugal, but even the United States, whose . Treasury bonds were once considered impregnable. Many households, banks and countries remain dangerously mired under the weight of their own foolish borrowings. Keep calm and carry on: A stock market trader grips his forehead as shares tumble in this picture from the 2008 crash. Dealers can and do wipe millions from the value of shares as the mood takes them . But panic does not help. We should not allow the economic recovery in . this country to be held hostage to hysteria in the dealing rooms. The dealers can and do wipe billions of pounds off share values as the . mood takes them – often for the points slashed from the FTSE 100 to be . restored the next day. But whatever their frenzy leads them to do, most of the real assets that . are vital to our economy remain unaffected.

      "66. By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 6:18 PM on 19th August 2011 . Banking stocks suffered a day of volatility as the morning's wave of market turmoil wiped 2.5 per cent from the value of the FTSE 100 Index. Recession fears and speculation of a short-term funding crisis in the European banking system ensured the top flight index remained under pressure after losing £62 billion or 4.5 per cent yesterday. The FTSE 100 fell as low as 4929.5 before steadying later in the session to stand 129 points lower at 4963.1. Traders were braced for another slump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after it closed more than 3 per cent lower last night. And despite a hint of an afternoon rebound, the London market closed 49.46 points (or 0.97 per cent) down, at 5,042.77. The tumbling figures were mirrored by European markets, with Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan stock markets, also showing losses. Wipe out: The FTSE plummeted today to 4,935 points as panic rippled through the banks . The latest downturn for world markets . followed a gloomy report from economists at investment bank Morgan . Stanley, which slashed its forecasts for global growth. But eurozone debt fears, poor . economic data in the US, and fears over China raising interest rates and . limiting its demand, all played their part in Thursday's rout. Banking stocks were again the major . casualties as the FTSE 100 Index slipped down again to below  the 5,000 . barrier, tumbling to 4,935 points. The volatile FTSE opened at 5,083 and after fluctuating, sank to 4,935 points. Last night the US benchmark Dow Jones . Industrial Average sank 3.7 per cent after London's FTSE 100 fell 4.5 per cent - the . 12th biggest points fall in its history - and wiping more than £62 . billion off the value of leading shares. Oil . prices fell to near $79 a barrel in Asia, extending a major sell-off . fueled by investor fears that slowing global growth will undermine . demand for crude. Despite the plummeting figures, there was still a willingness to invest, with U.S. giant Hewlett-Packard buying Cambridge-based data . search specialist Autonomy in a deal worth £7.1billion. The dollar was higher against the euro but down against the yen. Wall Street was headed for a slide, . with Dow Jones industrial futures down 1.5 per cent to 10,849 and S&P 500 . futures slipping 1.7 per cent to 1,123.80. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index . was the worst performer in Asia, falling 6.2 per cent, its lowest . close in nearly a year. A trader in Germany reacts the slump on European markets continued today . Plummeting: This graph shows how the FTSE crashed yesterday by 5 per . cent yesterday against a backdrop of the euro zone crisis and damaging U.S. unemployment figures . In the last five years, the lowest ebb of the FTSE was on March 9, 2009, when it plunged to 3,493 points. Today's drop to 4,935 is the second lowest. Yesterday the stock market suffered . its biggest collapse as the global economy . plunged deeper into crisis, wiping billions off the value of Britain's . leading companies. Every blue-chip firm listed in London . fell in the worst single day of trading in three years, since the dark days of 2008 when . investment bank Lehman Brothers imploded. As . analysts spoke of 'a tidal wave of selling', the FTSE 100 index fell . 239.37 points to 5092.23 – a drop in value of £62.3billion. These graphs show how global markets sharply dropped yesterday, with the FTSE plummeting to 5,092 points . Despair may have engulfed the markets, but one British entrepreneur found himself £300million richer yesterday. Dr Mike Lynch, the son of an Essex fireman, saw his software firm Autonomy sold to U.S. giant Hewlett-Packard for £7billion. The deal values his 8.1 per cent stake in the FTSE 100 firm at £567million. It was worth just under £284million before the takeover bid was announced. It is an extraordinary success for Dr Lynch, who began work on the firm when he was writing his post-doctoral thesis at Cambridge University on 18th century theologian Thomas Bayes, who tried to prove the existence of God through mathematics. Autonomy now has more than 16,000 clients worldwide including Nasa, Procter & Gamble, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The technology Dr Lynch developed allows computers to analyse data across a range of media, making it useful for tracking down fraud or even searching for terrorists. And Europe followed suit yesterday, with the German stock market . fell 5.8 per cent, Paris dropped 5.5 per cent and the Dow Jones . Industrial  Average dropped 3.9 per cent in  New York. The Lehman debacle tipped the global . economy into recession – and fears are mounting that the developed world . is on the brink of another devastating downturn. One reason for the panic was the . revelation that a lender in the eurozone was forced to go cap in hand to . the European Central Bank for £300million in emergency funding. Analysts said the 'worrying' development showed banks are too nervous to lend to each other – just as . they were at the height of the financial crisis. Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley . warned that the United States and the eurozone are 'hovering . dangerously close to recession'. Investors are also increasingly . concerned about the health of the banking system in Europe as the . debt-crisis crippling the single currency bloc rumbles on. Officials at the Bank of England said the exaggerated sense of fear in the markets may be holding back the recovery. As investors panic about the markets, they have turned to gold. The precious metal has hit a new record above $1,860 as investors reach for the safety of bullion amid a worsening economic outlook for the United States and fears about the health of Europe's banks. After opening this morning at $1,823, the spot gold price reached an all-time high of $1,867 shortly after. Yesterday, it had reached a new high of $1,826. The metal had hit nine record highs, and risen nearly 14 per cent so far this month -- its best month since September 1999. Damaging confidence: Analysts say German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to bail out debt-ridden eurozone members would disproportionately hit the UK . The man who became a hate figure to . many in Britain for designing the modern European Union yesterday . admitted that it was now 'on the edge of the precipice'. Jacques Delors, 86, a federalist . Frenchman, used his time as European Commission chief in the 1980s to . expand its power over national governments and pave the way for the . single European currency. Dark days: Today's jobless figures have done nothing for Barack Obama's domestic standing . Will Hedden, at IG Index in London, said: 'Panic selling accelerated in the biggest losing day yet of this summer sell-off. 'The fear factor has reached boiling . point. Banking stocks have been decimated across Europe, with . indiscriminate selling even in banks that maintain that their exposure . to the crisis is slim. 'No sector is surviving this tidal wave of selling.' The financial markets have been rocked . by a crisis of leadership in recent weeks as politicians on both sides . of the Atlantic failed to come up with policies to tackle debts and . promote growth. The FTSE 100 index has lost 1,000 points, or £260billion of its value, since its 2011 peak in February. The majority of the slump has taken place this month in one of the most bruising episodes in stock market history. It has hit the value of retirement . pots for millions and left investors across the country nursing heavy . losses. UK bank shares were the worst hit in London yesterday with . taxpayer-supported Royal Bank of Scotland down 11.3 per cent and Lloyds . Banking Group down 9.3 per cent. The shares are worth less than half . what they were when the Government bailed the banks out – meaning UK . taxpayers are sitting on losses of £34.5billion in the two companies. The European banking sector has lost . 30 per cent of its value this year. French banks were back in the firing . line yesterday with Societe Generale down 11.6 per cent. It came after . the ECB provided more than £300million of emergency funds to an unnamed . lender – the first such loan since February. 'This shows that the situation has escalated,' said Citigroup analyst Juergen Michels. Morgan Stanley cut its global growth . forecasts for this year from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent and for 2012 . from 4.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent. 'The path now looks even more bumpy, . below-par and brittle than previously thought,' said Joachim Fels, who . co-heads Morgan Stanley's global economic team. He said the main reason for the . downturn was the failure of politicians and regulators in Washington and . Europe to tackle the sovereign debt crisis crippling the world economy.\n",
      "67. By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 10:19 PM on 27th July 2011 . Alive: Arthur Gerald Jones, 72, disappeared more than 30 years ago . The man who forced a probe that found a former commodities broker alive after he disappeared in 1979 and was declared legally dead has been revealed as a Phoenix nurse. Clifton Goodenough, 50, a nurse in a veterans’ hospital in Arizona, fought with the Internal Revenue Service as they kept taking funds from his bank account and cutting his wages. But after 16 years of grief, the mystery was solved when father-of-three Arthur Gerald Jones, 72, of Chicago, Illinois, was found living under a false name and working at a casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Jones was reported missing in 1979 and declared dead by an Illinois court in 1986. FBI agents had investigated his disappearance as suspicious and focused on possible mob connections. Jones was arrested last Tuesday on four counts related to identity theft and fraud after officials say he renewed his Nevada driver's licence in 2008 under his assumed name, Joseph Richard Sandelli. Jones allegedly paid a friend in Chicago $800 for fake documents and a Social Security number belonging to Mr Goodenough before he disappeared, authorities say, which caused the Arizona man untold grief. Mr Goodenough was involved in a . long-term battle with the IRS over ‘extra income’ he had supposedly . earned in Las Vegas every year since 1995 and had annual financial . issues to resolve. He told MailOnline that he even went as far as to employ a certified public accountant because he was having so many financial issues to sort out. The IRS were querying him 'every year or sometimes more,' he said. Hideout: Jones settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book, authorities said . But eventually the IRS provided . documents naming a person he could link to his troubles in ‘Sandelli’, . who was using his Social Security number, reported the Las Vegas . Review-Journal. Mr Goodenough actually called . ‘Sandelli’ last year to chat about their shared problem on the phone, but he . claims to have known something was up when they started discussing their . personal details. ‘The more I thought about it . afterward, I realised he was just agreeing with whatever real . information I'd say, to lead me to believe this was just a colossal . government mix-up' Clifton Goodenough . ‘I told him I was born in a Lake . Forest Hospital in Illinois, and he'd say: “So was I”,’ Mr Goodenough . told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ‘The more I thought about it . afterward, I realised he was just agreeing with whatever real . information I'd say, to lead me to believe this was just a colossal . government mix-up.’ Mr Goodenough also thought it was odd . that ‘Sandelli’ allegedly offered to get a new number from the Social . Security Administration even though he was around a retirement age. But Mr Goodenough continued to get . questions from the IRS about his earnings and eventually decided to . write to Arizona Republican and U.S. Senator John McCain's office for . help. Four months later a huge . investigation resulted in Jones allegedly admitting his story to investigators and . being charged. Mr Goodenough has praised Senator McCain's office ‘for . getting me a resolution’. ‘I'm just still kind of shocked and . amazed,’ he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ‘My family in Chicago . keeps seeing my name in the news.’ Jones' lawyer, Stephen Stein, said . last week the Nevada attorney general's office is offering his client a . plea deal that would allow him to plead guilty on one of the charges and . face probation. Jones was released on a $20,000 bond last week and is next set for an August 23 court hearing. ‘I'm just still kind of shocked and . amazed. My family in Chicago . keeps seeing my name in the news' Clifton Goodenough . A criminal complaint filed last week . in Las Vegas Justice Court painted the picture of a powerful Chicago . financier tormented by snowballing gambling debts. Jones told investigators he held a . seat with the Chicago Board of Trade and lived with his wife, Joanne . Esplin, and three young children in Highland Park, Illinois. But Jones said he was forced to sell his board seat to pay debts, according to the affidavit. Esplin said her husband forged her . name to get a second mortgage on the couple's home and pay personal . gambling debts, the document alleged. She said she suspected he was . delivering money or running errands for the Chicago mob. Assistance: Mr Goodenough was getting questions from the IRS about his earnings and eventually decided to write to Senator John McCain's office for help . His marriage troubled and finances in . shambles, Jones told investigators he decided to leave to get a 'fresh . start', the affidavit said. Esplin and Jones had been married 17 years . when he disappeared. According to the affidavit, Esplin . told investigators the last time she saw her husband - whose gambling . once led him to bet $30,000 on a basketball game - was May 11, 1979, . when he left to run an errand. She said he looked very nervous at the . time. Jones never spoke to his family or . friends again. Presuming he had died, Social Security paid his family . $47,000 in survivor benefits, the document said. Earlier this month, investigators . from the Social Security Administration contacted Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles officials. They were investigating Jones for using the Social Security number of . Mr Goodenough. Investigators say Jones used his . ‘Sandelli’ alias to get a Nevada driver's license when he moved to . Nevada in 1988, and renewed it in 2008. Authorities say he also lived in . Florida and California after leaving Chicago. According to investigators, he moved he settled in Las Vegas in 1988, where he worked for the Rampart Casino's Sports Book. Mr Stein said his client has friends in Las Vegas who 'consider him family' and who sprang to his defence after the arrest. A DMV spokesman said cases like this . are turning up more frequently as computer databases improve and law . enforcement agencies are better able to communicate among themselves.\n",
      "68. By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 8:48 PM on 26th October 2011 . Accused: Achilleas Kallakis at Southwark Crown Court . It was claimed his company had assets in excess of $1 billion. However, a property tycoon at the centre of a £750 million fraud ran his office from a basement with just 'two and a half computers', a court was told. Despite projecting an image of success and prosperity, Atlas Management Corporation was operating as if it was about to go bankrupt, with keys even falling off one computer keyboard as staff typed, it was claimed. Millionaire Achilleas Kallakis - allegedly at the company's helm - and his 'right hand man' Alex Williams are accused of using forged documents to con banks out of money to amass a property empire. Southwark Crown Court, in London, heard that Kallakis - who claims to come from a wealth Greek shipping dynasty dating back 200 years - asked accountants to cash cheques for him, for up to £20,000 at a time. It is thought Kallakis was using the . cash to fund . his 'very expensive lifestyle' of chauffeur-driven cars, private planes . and the upkeep of his own yacht, the court heard. Kallakis and Williams - both aged 43 - are alleged to have bought 16 landmark properties on the back of the cash, which was mainly forked out by Allied Irish Bank (AIB). However, AIB lost £56million when Atlas Management Corporation - which was based on forgeries - went bust. Victor Temple QC, prosecuting the case, said money was coming in but 'almost immediately coming out again.' The court today heard how Rodney Rezler, who was appointed chief accountant at the company, revealed how he was led to a basement room on his first day where there was only one working computer. Chartered account Mr Rezler told the court: 'On the day I arrived I was led to a small basement room where there was one and a half working computers. They were not networked. 'I managed after a few days to scrounge a computer for myself. This was a laptop where the keys would fall off as I typed. 'There was no company system as such. There were little pools of information sitting on individual computers some of which had been in the accounts office and had now moved to unknown places.' Kallakis and Alex Williams are accused of conning banks out of cash using forged documents to amass a property empire. Their trial is being heard at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) Mr Rezler said the accounts were so 'scattered' it was 'impossible' to check the rents were being paid on properties the company owned. Asked how the company's finances were, he said: 'It was catastrophic. We were constantly bombarded, as I put the phone down the phone would ring again from another creditor asking where their money was. It was almost impossible to work. 'The company wasn't paying its bills. It was behaviour normally expected in companies that were about to go bankrupt.' Mr Rezler said he told Mr Williams this but added: 'His basic view was that future financial ease would be coming. Large amounts of money were promised to follow through down the line and the problems would be dealt with.' 'The company was absorbing more money than it was producing' When asked about Kallakis, Mr Rezler replied: 'Mr Kallakis was rarely in the office. One would often know if he had been in the office as he had a tendency to smoke cigars when he was around so one detected cigar smoke but not Mr Kallakis. 'Three months in I spoke to him about the accounts when I found that the situation had got worse because Mr Kallakis, having felt the property managers was not doing their job properly, had decided to review all the invoices personally. This created a bigger and bigger backlog. 'The company was actually absorbing more money than it was producing. It seemed money was being supplied into the company but there was not sufficient money coming in from rents to pay back loans. 'Mr Kallakis had a very expensive lifestyle. It was clear that a lot of money that went out was to pay for monthly requirements to run things because he had the yacht, the plane, accommodation costs.' Asked by Mr Temple if he had ever been told anything about Kallakis' claim he was a Greek shipping heir, Mr Rezler said: 'Yes, he said the business had been in the family for about 200 years. 'My impression was it was an extremely wealthy shipping company that had been underpinning the establishment of the property business and that the property business itself was in control of about one billion dollars worth of assets.' Mr Rezler told the court he had seen other accountants being asked to sign blank cheques on occasion. Earlier chartered account Alf Burgess, who worked for Kallakis for almost six years, said: 'It could be anything from £2,000 or £20,000, but that [£20,000] was a one-off.' Asked by Mr Temple who asked him to do that, Mr Burgess replied: 'Mr Kallakis.' 'Did you ever query that with Mr Kallakis?' asked Mr Temple. 'No, Mr Kallakis was the boss. He told me what to do,' Mr Burgess said. Mr Rezler eventually resigned from the company before it went into liquidation as he was concerned Atlas Management was trading illegallym the court heard. Kallakis and Williams deny two counts of conspiracy to defraud, 13 counts of forgery, five counts of fraud by false representation, two counts of money laundering and one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception. The trial continues.\n",
      "69. By . Hannah Roberts . Last updated at 9:45 AM on 31st October 2011 . Ruth Madoff has said that she blames herself for her son Mark's suicide. Mark Madoff hanged himself with a dog leash on the second anniversary of his father Bernie Madoff's arrest for running the biggest financial fraud in history. He had wanted his mother to cut off all contact with his father. Speaking for the first time since her disgraced financier husband's sensational arrest three years ago, Ruth Madoff now says she wishes she had severed ties with her husband as Mark wanted. Guilt: Ruth Madoff has said that she blames herself for her son Marks' suicide. Previously she was reported to have held Bernie, now serving a 150-year prison . sentence for his record-breaking scam, responsible for her son's death. In an interview with CBS broadcast tonight, Ruth said: 'I just wish, until my dying day, that I had done what he wanted. 'I don't know if it would have made a difference or not, but if I could change things, at least if I had tried, I would have felt a little better. I don't know if it would have mattered. She added: 'It's the most awful thing that can happen to anybody- the suicide of a child.' The Madoffs' other son, Andrew, also appears in the interview with '60 Minutes' Disgraced: Bernie Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence . Ruth and her sons barely spoke in the two years after his father's arrest because, Andrew Madoff said, he and his brother could not understand her decision to stay by their father's side. 'I never thought of leaving,' Ruth Madoff said. 'I didn't know what else to do but stay there.' 'I think he got stuck, that's what he said. And he didn't have the courage to face things when they might have been able to be faced on a much smaller scale,' she said. After Mark killed himself in his Soho loft, aged 46, Ruth Madoff cut off contact with her husband and now lives in a three-room apartment in South Florida. That decision led to a reconciliation with her other son Andrew. When the interviewer asked why she hadn't filed for divorce, she said: 'It doesn't matter to me -- he's going to die in prison.' The devastated mother claims she . understood Mark's decision, as the family fell spectacularly from grace, . 'going through those agonies of shame.' In . a segment of the interview revealed earlier this week Ruth claimed that . she and Bernie themselves attempted suicide on Christmas Eve. Despite taking all the sleeping pills they had in the house (Bernie took more she said) the couple simply woke up the next day. Describing the decision in tonight's programme, she claimed it hadn't been a difficult one. But ultimately she said she was glad the couple woke up the next day none the worse. Meanwhile Madoff has cast some doubt on this story by denying from his prison cell that he ever attempted suicide. Suicide: Mark Madoff, with wife Stephanie, before he killed himself on the 2nd anniversary of his father's arrest . Anger: Andrew Madoff said he had also been angered by his mother Ruth's decision to stand by his father Bernie Madoff . In tonight's interview, Ruth broke . down as she looked at a picture of her two sons with their father in . what she called 'happier times'. The programme is being aired the night before . 'Truth and Consequences: Life Inside the Madoff Family', the latest . tell-all on the infamous saga goes on sale. The account is written by author Laurie Sandell, . who says she was approached by Andrew Madoff and his fiancee, Catherine Hooper, . to write about the family's painful experience. The book also showcases never-seen-before family pictures of the Madoffs. Younger son Andrew also used the programme to speak out about his brother's suicide. Catherine Hooper, Andrew's fiancee helped him approach writer Laurie Sandell about the book 'Truth and Consequences: Life Inside the Madoff Family' Happier times: Bernie and Ruth Madoff fell in love in 1954. She says he swept her off her feet . Young: Financial swindler Bernard Madoff eventually defrauded investors out of an estimated $65 billion . Childhood: In the interview Ruth Madoff broke down as she looked at a picture of her two sons in what she called 'happier times'. Describing Mark's final months he said: 'I had tried to talk to him, to understand what he was going through. 'It was very painful for me and very difficult for me, but I was making it through.To see him struggling and not making it was terrible. 'We were very close. He was my best friend. And I wanted to help him. The other Madoffs have always claimed to have known nothing about Bernie's Ponzi scheme. But defrauded Madoff investors have . long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member . suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his . lies. No family members have been criminally charged. The Madoffs used tonight's interview to reiterate that position. 'I . can't explain it, I mean I trusted him,' Ruth Madoff said when asked . how she could not have known of her husband's crime. 'Why would it ever . occur to me that it wasn't legal?' Family man: Bernie and Ruth madoff with sons Mark and Andrew. Before Bernie's arrest for fraud, the Madoffs were very proud of who they were Ruth said in the new interview . Brothers: Andrew Madoff told CBS that he wanted to help his brother Mark and hated seeing him unable to cope with the family crisis . 'There was nothing that would ever make me suspect anything,' she said. In . tonight's broadcast Andrew claimed his mother Ruth's first question . when her husband confessed, sobbing, to the massive fraud was 'What's a . Ponzi scheme?' 'She didn't . even understand that. I think it was me who answered and said that 'It . means that it's all fake,'' Andrew Madoff said. '(My father) followed . that up and said 'Yes, I've been lying to all of you - all of these . years. I've been lying to everybody. I've been lying to myself.'' Madoff's . younger son said his father's investment advisory business, the Ponzi . scheme, was 'a completely separate business' to the trading business . where he and his brother worked. 'We . were executing hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. And that . kept all of us incredibly busy. And it just -- it just didn't occur to . me that he could be involved in any kind of criminal activity,' he said. Luxury: Growing up the Madoff boys lived a lavish lifestyle and wanted for nothing. After college both worked for their father Bernie . Close: Andrew Madoff said his brother Mark was his best friend . Letdown: Andrew Madoff said one of the hardest things for him to come to terms with was the feeling that he and his brother were used by his father, who shielded his Ponzi scheme with their legitimate trading business. One of the hardest things for Andrew to come to terms with was the feeling that he and his brother were used by his father, who shielded his Ponzi scheme with their legitimate trading business. 'It's unforgivable,' he said. 'No father should do that to their sons.' 'What he did to me, to my brother, and to my family is unforgivable,' Andrew Madoff said. 'What he did to thousands of other people, destroyed their lives -- I'll never understand it. And I'll never forgive him for it.' The interview coincides with a series of interviews by Mark's widow Stephanie Madoff Mack, who earlier this month released her own damning account of the family, The End Of Normal: A Wife's Anguish, A Widow's New Life.\n",
      "70. By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 5:50 PM on 12th November 2011 . Extravagant: Tony Billings led a double life and fleeced people of cash to shower his lover with gifts . A married fantasist stole £430,000 to pay for extravagant gifts and foreign holidays for a woman he was obsessed with. Tony Billings lived an extravagant and a bizarre double life, purporting to be a wealthy businessman to impress the 'love of his life' during their affair, Leicester Crown Court was told. Billings posed as a chartered accountant with a PhD from the London School of Economics and convinced colleagues and friends he was phenomenally successful. The ex-bookkeeper, described as 'singularly average' by his lawyer, smooth-talked his way into a directorship of sports company, Tennis Midlands Ltd, based at Loughborough University. He stole £360,000 from the business, causing it to collapse. He also duped fellow director and Leicestershire tennis professional, David Ireland, out of £70,000 savings, saying he was investing the cash for him. Self-styled 'Dr Billings' always drove new cars and showered his lover - a Derbyshire hairdresser, with treats, including jewellery, cases of champagne and toys for her children. He even gave her £100,000 to pay her divorce settlement and took her to New York and Sri Lanka  - giving her £700-a-month to be his 'research assistant'. However the 52-year-old's excessive lifestyle crashed back to reality when he was sentenced to four years in prison on Thursday. Academic: Billings falsley posed as a chartered accountant with a PhD from the London School of Economics (pictured) His wife, Anne Billings, who signed over the last £28,000 equity on their home before he was made bankrupt, was seated in the public gallery, still supporting him despite his infidelity. Judge . Michael Pert QC said: 'I'm told the reason you stole was to lavish money . on a woman other than your long-suffering wife and this is somehow an . excuse in your mind for what you did. 'You're . a thief. You lived a lie, sitting in an office with plaques and awards . and Financial Times articles on the wall and certificates of academic . excellence - all lies'. Billings, a father of one, from Oakwood, Derby, admitted theft and fraud. John Hallissey, prosecuting, said: 'Over the course of several years Billings lived a double life. 'He . invented a world for himself in which he was a successful, wealthy . economist, a professor, who was able to make substantial sums of money . in the stock market. 'With . extravagant claims and spending he convinced his friends, work . colleagues and even a woman he was in a relationship with of his . financial prowess and success. His whole world was a sham and his entire . lifestyle was financed by theft or fraud. 'In 2007 he trained as a tennis coach at the Nottingham Tennis Centre. It was there he met David Ireland'. Big Apple: Billings took his lover on trips abroad including New York (pictured) Even when arrested, Billings was bizarrely secretly instructing solicitors in the purchase of an £870,000 house. He falsely claimed to have once owned an accountancy business and offered to help with the club's books. He . assisted associates from the club to apply for Lawn Tennis Association . funding to establish a tennis coaching performance programme at the LTA . Academy at Loughborough University. When . the bid was successful he was offered a directorship of the business, . Tennis Midlands Ltd, with responsibility for the finances, because of . his so called expertise. Mr . Hallissey said Billings adorned his office wall with photos of articles . from the Financial Times, with his name superimposed on them. Early in 2010 the cracks began to appear and staff were not paid for three months. He made excuses, blaming cash flow and the death of his father - who was still alive. On . June 21, 2010,  he failed to turn up for work and sent a text message . saying he 'cannot go on any more' to one of the staff saying Tennis . Midlands had ceased trading the previous week. Mr Hallissey said: 'For several years he treated Tennis Midlands' account as though it was his own personal current account. 'Between 2008 and 2010 he stole and spent around £400,000. 'He . was wooing a woman he'd known for some time through tennis clubs. He . would carry ostentatiously large bundles of cash.In June 2010 he was . made bankrupt'. Defence counsel, Philip Bown, said: . 'His deluded behaviour was to maintain an interest of this lady who . clearly was the love of his life. 'He was motivated by desperation to impress her. His lies and dishonesty left misery and destruction in its wake'. When his lover found out about his bankruptcy, he told her: 'If I lose you, I've lost everything'. Mr Brown described him as being mentally fragile, suffering from depression and having low self-esteem. Billings . met his lover in 2004. To maintain her interest he told her he was . suffering from testicular cancer, when it wasn't true. 'He's . a singularly average man, married for many years and was formerly a . bookkeeper. He was besotted by her and lost touch with reality'. Speaking after the sentencing Mr . Ireland, 40, said: 'It's shocking and disgusting that someone you work . with and trust could do such a thing. 'It's one of the harsh lessons in life. 'You . hope not to meet those sorts of people. He was plausible, spent a lot . of time at work, was always the first in the office, and appeared to . have the best interests of the company at heart, which wasn't the case.

Jailed: Shaun Oates, a City trader who lost his employer £4.8m in a series of reckless gambles, has been handed a five-year sentence . A City trader, who came to the UK to 'seek his fortune' but ended up losing his company £4.8m in a series of reckless gambles has been jailed for five years. Shaun Oates, 31, of New Addington, Surrey, left . TRX Futures with the massive black hole in its accounts after blowing . the cash on speculative deals in the futures, options and foreign . exchange markets. The firm had to cut salaries and lay off two employees in an attempt to balance its books, while Oates pocketed £775,000 for himself. Oates broke company rules by setting up a trading account for his own front company, Cynthen Capital, and then faking records to show it had deposited $5m, the Old Bailey heard. Oates also deleted successful trades from real clients' records, before diverting the profits and buying two houses with £775,000 of ill-gotten gains. Warning Oates that he faces deportation to his native South Africa, Judge Peter Thornton QC said he had engaged in a 'deliberate course of dishonest conduct over nearly two years.' He said: 'It was designed to make money for yourself, which in due course it did - although at the expense of others. 'It goes without saying that fraud of this kind affects public confidence in the City.' The court heard that the con artist, who began working for TRX in 2006, came unstuck when bosses finally noticed the huge losses and called in the police in last November. As the firm's project and risk manager, his job was to minimise the company's exposure to financial uncertainty. Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Oates continued to deny any wrongdoing in meetings with company managers and refused to answer any questions in a police interview after his arrest. After the fraud was uncovered, the firm lost £4.86m, some 30 per cent of its capital. Peter Hunter, defending, said the con failed after the markets 'became turbulent' in late 2008. He said: 'Every time he did a trade and lost, instead of stopping he tried to double his trade to recoup the loss - he tried to trade his way out. Court: Judge Peter Thornton QC warned Oates that he faces deportation to his native South Africa, during the hearing at the Old Bailey today . 'Eventually, the losses became awful and he had no choice but to approach his employers. 'He has asked me to apologise to the court and to all concerned. He is thoroughly ashamed.' Oates first moved to the UK in 2004 after graduating with a degree in accounting and economics from Stellenbosch University, near Cape Town. Mr Hunter said: 'He came to this country, in fact, to seek his fortune. 'Whilst here, his mother came into difficulties with finances, and his brother became addicted to drugs, so he was under pressure to find money. 'The original desire was to help them. 'Every asset he had has been taken, and everything from his bank account to the house he lived in has been repossessed and taken back. 'There was no extravagant lifestyle, he wasn't driving a flash car. 'The profit to this man is nothing.' Oates admitted two counts of fraud by abuse of position.\n",

Bernie Madoff's daughter-in-law has revealed how her husband gushed about their future in a romantic wedding anniversary card - just two months before he killed himself. Stephanie Madoff Mack’s disclosure comes one year after Mark Madoff, 46, was found hanged in his New York loft apartment - as their two-year-old son Nicholas slept in the next room. The suicide fell on the second anniversary on the arrest of his father, disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence for masterminding a $60billion financial scam. Happier times: Stephanie Madoff Mack, left, said how her husband Mark, right, left her a note gushing about their future just months before he hanged himself. She is still unable to make sense of his death, she added . In a blog post, Mack said her late husband had given her a card for their sixth anniversary bearing an optimistic message. She revealed that, a year on, she is still confused about why her husband killed himself when he was so excited about their future. ‘Dear Stephanie,’ the card read. ‘Another year. Another great year. I am so happy waking up next to you. I am so happy that your smile is the last thing that I see before closing my eyes at night. So much to look forward to. I love you. Mark.’ Writing for the Huffington Post, she also recalled their conversation during their celebratory dinner. Together: Writing a year after her husband's death, Stephanie Madoff Mack said their two young children, Nicholas and Audrey, still say they miss their father every day. She no longer speaks to the Madoff family . Shamed family: Fraudster Bernie Madoff, left, with his wife Ruth and son Mark . at a dinner in Long Island in 2001. Mark Madoff was found dead at his . apartment in Manhattan two years after his father's arrest for fraud . It ‘weighed the pros and cons of moving out of New York City to raise our two children in the suburbs’, she said. ‘We talked about possibly having a third child.’ She added: ‘What I remember about that . dinner is that we were like any other normal couple, in love, . celebrating their wedding anniversary. For their sixth wedding anniversary, which they celebrated two months before his death, Mark Madoff wrote Stephanie a card, which read: . Dear Stephanie. Another . year. Another great year. I am so happy waking up next to you. I am so . happy that your smile is the last thing that I see before closing my . eyes at night. So much to look forward to. I love you. Mark . ‘We were not the son and daughter-in-law of Bernard Madoff, the man who turned our life upside down.’ She also described how she was still haunted by questions surrounding his death, which friends have said was borne out of Mark’s fear he would be locked up like his father. ‘His inner turmoil is something I still struggle with every day,’ she wrote. ‘I re-read his last email to me: \"I love you\" and his last email to his lawyer: \"Please take care of my family\" and still can make no sense of what he did. None.’ She also expressed her regret that he was not witnessing their two children, Nicholas and Audrey, growing up – and that the children spoke of him every day. ‘He should be here to see how big Nicholas has gotten,’ she wrote. ‘Their heads are the same shape, and Nick is always pushing his sleeves up the way Mark did. It makes me laugh, and then I immediately think: Mark should be here. ‘A day does not go by without either one telling me sadly that they miss Daddy.’ Tragedy: Officials carry Mark's body out of his New York apartment after he was found hanged by a dog leash .

Ms Madoff Mack, who wrote a book entitled The End of Normal about her part in the family, has publicly fought with the rest of the Madoffs following the death of her husband. After she continued to contact Bernie, his wife Ruth was banned from Mark’s funeral. Mr Madoff was overwhelmed with grief and looked 'like someone had shot him in the stomach' when he heard that Mark had committed suicide, a fellow inmate said. After her husband's Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008, Ruth was warned by her sons Mark and Andrew to leave him or lose contact with them . Divided: The Madoff family, (L-R) Ruth, Bernie, Andrew and Mark, were torn apart by the arrest. Ruth, who was banned from Mark's funeral, angered her sons when she continued to support her disgraced husband . At the time she chose her sons. But after Mr Madoff was attacked in prison in 2009 she returned to his side, and her furious sons then severed all ties with her. Mr Madoff revealed earlier this year that his family no longer speak to him following his multi-billion-dollar fraud. Ruth has stopped visiting in a bid to salvage a relationship with her second son, Andrew.\n",
      "73. By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 1:26 AM on 10th February 2012 . Victoria Fraenzel had no idea that Upton was a married father-of-one . To his clients, he was a happily married accountant who they trusted to look after their affairs. But in reality, Darren Upton was stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from them so he could live a luxury lifestyle and keep a glamorous mistress. The 40-year-old had begun a relationship with blonde model Victoria Fraenzel, 36, after using an internet dating website and pretending to be single. He bought her sexy lingerie, set her up in an £800 a month flat, gave her spending money and provided her with designer clothes and Mulberry handbags. Upton also paid for Bentley and Maserati cars with personalised number plates for himself and his wife, splashed out on a £10,000 box at Leeds United football club and even spent £3,000 on a model railway. Miss Fraenzel had no idea her lover was married with an 18-month-old child until she rang his office and was put in touch with his wife Tina, Leeds Crown Court was told. In total the accountant left 33 clients and the taxman with losses of more than half a million pounds. Yesterday Upton was jailed for six years after admitting 15 fraud offences between January 2010 and June last year. He asked for 23 similar offences to be taken into consideration. Upton, who had previously been investigated and forced to pay compensation for an unauthorised investment scheme, had continued to commit offences when he was on bail. Passing sentence, Judge Sally Cahill, QC, said the crimes were committed for ‘pure selfish greed’. She told him: ‘You were thoroughly dishonest and motivated by greed. This was a gross breach of trust, it was planned from the offset and fraudulent from the offset. 'I consider this to be professional offending at a high level.’ Prosecuting, Nick Worsley said the defendant was director of Upton and Co Accountants in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and his wife worked as the company secretary. The firm had around 800 clients, mainly small information technology companies.Instead of paying his clients’ Corporation Tax to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, Upton used their cash and diverted it into his own account for personal use. The total value of his fraud was £532,000. His clients even ended up having to pay penalties for unpaid tax when his crimes were exposed.Upton, of Woodlesford, Leeds, made excuses when questions arose and eventually staff at his firm reported him to the police. Darren Upton met make-up artist and part time model Victoria Fraenzel on a dating website . Family man: The home in Leeds where Upton lives with his wife Tina and their 18-month-old child . Mr Worsley said many of the clients he deceived felt totally betrayed as they regarded him as a friend, while one even had Upton as a guest at his wedding. Other victims said their businesses had been left close to collapse and they had suffered ill health. One said: ‘I am absolutely devastated I have been left in this position and it has had a massive effect on my business.’ He said he could no longer take on staff because of Upton’s betrayal. The main beneficiary of Upton’s greed and spending was Miss Fraenzel, a  make-up artist and part-time model. After meeting her in October 2010, Upton paid the deposit and rent on a flat in Salford for her to use, the court heard. He began paying for a Mercedes sports car for her and gave her a living allowance. He bought her clothes from Harvey Nichols, Mulberry handbags and Ann Summers lingerie. The court heard they enjoyed nights out at Hilton hotels and she considered herself to be his girlfriend until she discovered he was married. James Littlehayles, defending, claimed Upton made a legitimate annual profit of £250,000, but began offending because he was forced to repay £840,000 to the Financial Services Authority in monthly instalments of £10,000 in connection with the earlier unauthorised investment scheme, which had not led to criminal charges. Luxury: Upton used £14,500 to refinance a Bentley Continental, pictured, which was in breach of a court order issued when he was arrested (library picture) ‘He was not prepared to cut back on . his lifestyle. Rather than give up his box at Leeds United and the . vehicles which he had previously legitimately funded, he then starts to . misappropriate clients’ funds,’ he said. After the case, Detective Sergeant Gary Ferris said he was delighted his victims had seen justice served. ‘He [Upton] was incredibly deceitful,’ he said. ‘Not only was he stealing monies from his clients, he was also . blackening their names with the HMRC and continued to carry out his . crimes even when he was on bail.’\n",
      "74. By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:52 EST, 7 March 2012 . The world's most notorious computer hacker turned against his comrades because he did not want to go to prison and leave behind his two children, it has been revealed. Top members of hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec have been arrested across two continents after their leader, 28-year-old Hector Xavier Monsegur, turned them in. In a startling show of betrayal towards his fellow hackers, the father-of-two spent the last six months working as an FBI informant, leading authorities to the five people who have now been charged in court papers in New York. Monsegur, who has been described as the ringleader of LulzSec, and an 'influential member' of Anonymous, pleaded guilty to a dozen hacking-related charges last summer - crimes which carry a maximum sentence of 124 years and six months in prison. But, rather than face a lengthy jail sentence and not see his two children, the unemployed father agreed to cooperate with the FBI, and, ever since his arrest, has reportedly been working with them to bring down the groups' top hackers. Betrayal: The leader of hacking group LulzSec has been identified as Hector Xavier Monsegur. Since his arrest last June, he has reportedly been working with the FBI to identify other members . The suspects include four LulzSec members - two men from Great Britain and two from Ireland - and one member of Anonymous - an American named Jeremy Hammond from . Chicago. 'This is devastating to the organization,' an FBI official told Fox News. 'We’re chopping off the head of LulzSec.' The hackers have claimed to be . responsible for a number of attacks on large companies, law enforcement . and government agencies, including the CIA, FBI and Sony. They are believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies. Fox News reported that FBI agents broke down Monsegur, who works under the alias of Sabu, by using his children against him. ‘It was because of his kids,’ one of the . two arresting agents told the news channel. ‘He’d do anything for his kids. He . didn’t want to go away to prison and leave them. That’s how we got him.’ Monsegur had been living in New York's Lower East Side when he was seized by authorities because of his own carelessness. They found his address after he logged into a chatroom without masking his IP - the address which shows a user's whereabouts. Authorities launched surveillance and watched him for weeks - but were forced to move when a rival hacker revealed Monsegur's identity online. Caught: The information he provided reportedly led to charges for five top members across two continents. Four worked for LulzSec and one for Anonymous, whose supporters wear Guy Fawkes masks, as pictured . The hacker group led by Hector Xavier Monsegur is believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies . Anonymous is the umbrella term used to represent an internet subculture – a collection of online individuals, or 'hacktivists', who share common ideas of anti-censorship and freedom of speech on the internet. They have carried out cyber attacks on Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon, and have threatened to take down Facebook and Twitter servers. Although it is not formerly . affiliated with it, the group has connections with the lesser-known . hacking group LulzSec. LulzSec, short for Lulz Security, is an offshoot of Anonymous and some members have been parts of both collectives . LulzSec is an elite . computer hacker group that has claimed responsibility for several . high-profile, debilitating cyber attacks. Their big hits include the compromising of user account data from Sony Pictures and taking the CIA website offline. They also attacked Fox.com, leaking . the names of more than 7,000 X Factor contestants, and the PBS Newshour . website, where they posted a story claiming that slain killer Tupac was . still living and in New Zealand. The group aims to cause mayhem as well as manipulate flaws in security and passwords systems. Fearing he would destroy his hard . drives - and thus evidence needed to prove his guilt - they went to . arrest him in June last year. Monsegur initially tried to deny he was the man the FBI were after. ‘It’s not me, you got the wrong guy,’ he allegedly said, according to sources who witnessed the interaction. ‘I don’t have a computer.’ At this point, one of the FBI agents . threatened to have the father locked up, which is when he caved in and . agreed to cooperate with them. He pleaded guilty to 12 counts of hacking . charges on August 15 but went on living in the Manhattan unit he shared with his children, supporting them and five brothers and a sister. His records were unsealed today, charging him with conspiracy to engage in computer hacking, among other charges. The 27-page indictment describes him as an . 'influential member of three hacking organizations — Anonymous, Internet . Feds and Lulz Security — that were responsible for multiple cyber . attacks on the computer systems of various businesses and governments in . the United States and throughout the world'. They claim he acted as a 'rooter', a computer hacker who identified vulnerabilities in computer systems. As part of Anonymous, court . papers claim he took part cyber attacks from December 2010 until last . June, including attacks on Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, and further . attacks on government computers in Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen and . Zimbabwe. As part of Internet Feds, he is alleged to have participated in attacks against businesses including HBGary Inc., a private security firm and Fox Broadcasting Co. And he is accused of forming LulzSec last May with other hackers, who then attacked Sony, PBS and the United States Senate, among others. Monsegur was free on $50,000 bail. Also charged in court papers with . conspiracy to commit computer hacking were Ryan Ackroyd and Jake Davis . from Great Britain, Darren Martyn and Donncha O’Cearrbhail of . Ireland, and an American named Jeremy Hammond from Chicago. Davis, who already faces a number of charges in the UK relating to alleged hacking by LulzSec, and Ackroyd, 23, were charged with two counts of computer hacking conspiracy. Each count of computer hacking conspiracy carries a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. It is understood that Scotland Yard is also running parallel inquiries into Ackroyd and Davis’ alleged activities within LulzSec. It has been reported that it is unlikely anyone would be extradited before the UK trials had concluded. Another English teenager Ryan Cleary, . was arrested by British law enforcement in June last year and was charged with being . linked to the group. Questions: Jerermy Hammond from Chicgo, Illinois (left in 2009) and Donncha O’Cearrbhail of Ireland (right) Charges: Sources named Jake Davis (left), from the United Kingdom, as one of the hackers facing charges. English teenager Ryan Cleary, (right) already faces hacking charges, allegedly as part of LulzSec . The arrested member of Anonymous, Jeremy Hammond from Chicago, has been charged with one count of computer hacking conspiracy, one count . of computer hacking, and one count of conspiracy to commit access device . fraud. He . reportedly caused the hacking of Stratfor Security Intelligence, which . led to the leak of 200GB worth of emails then published on Wikileaks. Fox sources said Hammond will be charged in a separate indictment. Darren Martyn, 25, of Galway, Ireland, has been charged with two counts of computer hacking conspiracy, while Donncha O'Cearrbhail, 19, of Birr, Ireland, has been charged with one count of computer hacking conspiracy and one charge of unlawfully intercepted wire communication, which carries a sentence of up to five years. The charge sheets detail how central Monsegur was in building the FBI's case against those arrested. According to the indictment written by the investigating FBI officer, 'CW' or Sabu, communicated with other hackers 'acting under the direction of the FBI'. From information taken from internet chat logs 'recorded by the FBI with the CW's consent', one document relating to O’Cearrbhail reveals how he recorded a conference call between the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency and the FBI. The file was received by Monsegur and verified by the FBI. The FBI was then able to refer to another conversation between the pair where O’Cearrbhail, who was writing under several names, revealed his identity. O’Cearrbhail faces up to 15 years in prison if he is extradited and convicted. Fox claims Monsegur has been feeding authorities information about LulzSec ever since his arrest, bringing them down from the . inside. Yet he has continued to be a public face . for the movement, tweeting to his followers on Monday: 'The federal . government is run by a bunch of f****** cowards. Don't give in to these . people. Fight back. Stay strong.' In August, 2011, it came to light . that Anonymous had hacked into 70 law enforcement websites, mostly local . sheriffs’ websites in Missouri. The hacks had occurred four weeks . before they were discovered. Using information passed on by Monsegur, the FBI . was able to work with the server company to mitigate the damage, Fox . claims. Mass damage: The hacking group Anonymous, whose logo is pictured, is . believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, . banks and government agencies . The FBI then alerted 300 government, . financial and corporate entities around the world to potential . vulnerabilities in their computer systems. Stories . have also emerged about Sabu's far-reaching power. When the CIA found . itself under siege from LulzSec hackers, Sabu, working for the . government, told them to stop, and they did. 'He's a rockstar,' a New York-based . hacker told Fox. 'All the girls, you buy them a drink, but all they want . to talk about is Sabu, Sabu, Sabu.' Barrett Brown, a former journalist . who became closely associated with Anonymous, said Sabu's betrayal would . have a serious effect on the group. 'He was an admired Anon,' he told AP. 'He's been a leader. People came to him with information. God knows what else he told them.'\n",

A bomb exploded outside a Greek ministry responsible for axing 150,000 public sector jobs last night - apparently in protest at government spending cuts. Windows were smashed and desks were damaged in the blast outside the Public Sector Reform Ministry in Athens. The department are axeing 150,000 government posts by 2015 in an austerity drive. Blast: An explosion ripped through the ground floor of the Greek administrative reform ministry in the early hours of the morning . The explosion happened just a day after protesters marching in memory of a man who killed himself over financial woes that he blamed on the government. Demonstrators marched after a memorial . service for Dimitris Christoulas, 77, a retired pharmacist who shot . himself in the Greek capital's Syntagma Square. His death has further galvanized Greeks angry over their leaders' implementation of tough austerity measures that are aimed at bringing . the country out of its fiscal crisis. Police said the bomb outside the reform ministry last night was made up of at least five gas canisters. No one was injured in the explosion. Probe: Investigators look at the damaged building after a home-made firebomb exploded. No one was injured . A police spokesman said: 'There was . no warning call and the risk of someone being injured was big, as the . building is centrally located.' The . attack was the second in under a week. A similar bomb exploded at the . office of former Prime Minister Costas Simitis last Tuesday. Greece's coalition government, led by technocrat Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, denounced that attack as an attempt to destabilise the country ahead of national elections expected on May 6. Clash: Workers from the Athens central groceries market confront riot police on Good Friday outside the Bank of Greece in some of the latest skirmishes in the Greek capital . As the country struggles with . austerity, insurers have claimed that hard-up superyacht owners across . Europe are torching vessels they can no longer afford and want to get . rid of. Madeira has been dubbed the 'Greece of the Atlantic' - because it has debts 50 per cent higher per person than the rest of Portugal. The island, with a population of 250,000, owes €6bn (£5bn) as a result of over-development. A drive to turn the island into a rival to the Canary Islands has failed - and now the inhabitants are counting the cost. Portugal has been forced to negotiate a €78bn (£64bn) IMF bailout. The European Union alone spent £2.9bn on the island before the financial crisis started as money is poured into redevelopment on an island that was still a dictatorship until 1974. The island has been ruled by President Alberto Joao Jardin since 1978 - and he secured another four-year term last October. He has overseen a huge programme of public sector spending and infrastructure building. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Madeira was very poor before, and the only way forward was increasing the public debt. 'If I hadn't done that, we'd still be saddled with the rest of Portugal's debts today anyway.' Lloyds of London said they have faced an increase in insurance claims for yachts worth more than £1.6million. A number of those claims have come from the port of Piraeus. Loss adjusters Charles Taylor said they had seen 14 'suspicious' super yacht insurance claims in the last six months. Director Nick Smith told the Telegraph: 'Yacht insurance fraud is a common problem in any country when bad times arrive. 'It happened to a significant degree in Britain from 2009 as yacht owners, lumbered with marine mortgages they could no longer afford, tried to get rid of them and make insurance claims.' As Greece tackle their deficit, the Spain's economic minister said they should consider making rich people pay for their universal health coverage in an attempt to get public finances under control. The ruling party quickly dismissed the suggestion - and said Luis de Guindos was only expressing his own opinion. The centre-right government is desperate for ways to save money or increase revenue as it struggles to achieve tough deficit-reduction goals. International investors are increasingly shying away from buying Spanish debt - pushing up the country's borrowing costs. There are growing fears that Spain could be next in line for a bailout - after Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos suggested people who earn more than €100,000 (£82,500) should pay for their state healthcare. With an average salary of just €20,000 (£16,500), few people earn that much. The unemployment rate stands at about 23 percent and is projected to rise, the economy is shrinking and the government is warning things will get worse before they start to turn around.\n",

Jailed: Ian Maxwell, 61, from Wrexham in Wales - pictured here with grey hair and sunglasses - tricked three women into investing their life savings through him . A Falklands RAF pilot who callously duped his two elderly aunties and a third woman out of a total of £312,000 has been jailed for two years today. Businessman and financial adviser Ian Maxwell, 61, from Wrexham in Wales tricked the three women into investing their savings through him. One of his aunties, who suffers from dementia, was left £10,000 overdrawn and financially ruined after Maxwell blew her money and that of the two other women on items such as jewellery and an expensive car, Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales heard. Judge Niclas Parry told the father: 'These were despicable offences which have led to financial ruination for vulnerable, elderly victims. 'The case involved a serious breach of trust. Your elderly and mentally vulnerable victims trusted you professionally with their life savings. 'Some of the money was wasted on items of lavish luxury.' Maxwell admitted seven fraud offences between 2002 and 2008 and £250,000 is still unaccounted for. Prosecutor Jonathan Austin said aunt Vera Davies, in her 80s, gave Maxwell £35,000 to invest in an Australian company, to generate an income, having been assured by him that her cash would be safe. But Maxwell didn’t invest the money and monthly payments by him totaling £27,000 had been paid with her own cash or other money that he had. The barrister said the payments stopped in 2007 when Maxwell was in financial difficulties. Mrs Davies’s sister Dilys Williams, who died in 2010, was swindled out of £172,500. She suffered from dementia and was extremely vulnerable. 'She couldn’t handle her own finances. In 2005 the defendant obtained an enduring power of attorney over her finances. It’s clear she trusted the defendant,' Mr Austin said. 'That money was used to help his failing business interests.' Using his power of attorney, cash was transferred to him. Mrs Williams had to live in a residential home but monthly payments from her savings couldn’t be made, cheques bounced and she became £10,000 in the red. Counsel said eventually social services approached the Court of Protection to overwrite his power of attorney. Better times: Maxwell is a former RAF flight lieutenant who flew sorties during the Falklands War . The third victim was Judith Rich from Bath who is in her 60s . She made four payments totaling £105,000 for Maxwell to invest in Australia in return for a monthly income. She got back £32,000 over the years but in 2007 payments to her stopped. Mr Austin said : 'She asked for her money back and never got it and had to seek financial assistance from her local authority because of the impecunious position she found herself in.' The money had been her 'nest egg' for the future. The prosecutor said £250,000 was outstanding and Maxwell stood to benefit by £16,000 from Mrs Williams’s estate. Defence barrister John Wyn Williams told the judge it was a 'tragic day for Mr Maxwell and his family.' Counsel declared : 'He stands before you a broken man. 'From his high achievements in life he’s spiralled down to the bottom, facing a custodial sentence. 'His wife, his daughters and brother-in-law are here to support him on this difficult day for the family. They are ashamed and embarrassed about what has happened in his life.' Maxwell’s business began to falter in 2007 when he lost money in Pakistan. 'He wanted to shore up that business and it was that temptation which led him to these offences,' counsel explained. There were 'glowing' testimonials. He was a former school head boy, excelled at sport, took a chemistry degree, and was an RAF flight commander in the Falklands. He now had health problems. Mr Wyn Williams said : 'He initially borrowed the money with the intention of repaying it. He wants me to apologise for his actions. He wishes dearly that he could turn back the clock.'\n",

Allen Stanford was sentenced on Thursday to 110 years in prison for orchestrating one of the largest Ponzi schemes in U.S. history that had defrauded investors out of $7 billion in the course of 20 years. Stanford’s glittering billionaire innings that led to him being listed as the world’s 605th richest person was declared over by a fellow Texan judge who ignored last-minute pleas from his lawyers to reduce the sentence to less than four years. The courtroom in Houston was packed with more than 150 people – many of them the victims of Stanford’s various schemes. Jailbird: Convicted financier Allen Stanford arrives at Federal Court in Houston for sentencing . Two of the estimated 17,000 victims of Stanford’s fraud were allowed to address the court. Jaime . Escalona, who represented Latin American victims, addressed the hearing . before turning to stare directly at Stanford to tell him: ‘You, sir, . are a dirty, rotten, scoundrel.’ The . other victims’ spokesman, Angela Shaw, of the Stanford Victims . Coalition, said of the fraudster: ‘Allen Stanford has stolen more than . billions of dollars. He took our lives as we knew them.’ She said some . 28,000 people had lost money in the scam. Before learning his fate, Stanford, . dressed in green prison garb, a wide grin on his face, delivered a . rambling statement in which he claimed that he had done nothing wrong, . and that he was a scapegoat. Guilty: Stanford was convicted in March of 13 of 14 counts of fraud . He . blamed the federal government and a U.S.-appointed receiver who took . over his companies in 2009, saying they tore down his business empire . and prevented his investors from getting any of their money back. In March, following a seven-week trial, Stanford was convicted of 13 of 14 fraud-related counts, among them wire and mail fraud. Speaking for more than 40 minutes, Stanford told a judge he's ‘not here to ask for sympathy or forgiveness.’ Ever the showman, Stanford, 62, waved to . his elderly mother, Sammie Stanford, who sat in the well of the court . alongside Stanford’s daughter, Randi. Prosecutors sought a 230-year prison term, the maximum possible sentence, while the defense asked for a maximum of 44 months. The prosecutor told U.S. District Judge David Hitner: ‘230 years will not get anyone their money back but on sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum.’ Stanford’s attorney, Ali Fazel, objected to the use of the term ‘Ponzi scheme,’ but Hittner said the evidence at trial justified the use of the term. During the hearing, the prosecutors also compared him to the infamous New York City financier Bernie Madoff, who is currently serving a 150-year prison term for similar crimes. Stanford now plans to appeal against the conviction and sentence even though he was officially declared 'indigent' – penniless, which means that the government will have to spend tens of millions of dollars on court-appointed lawyers. He said: 'I’m not here to ask for sympathy or forgiveness or to throw myself at your mercy but I will tell you I did not run a Ponzi scheme. I didn’t defraud anybody.' The former honorary knight of Antigua was arrested in 2009. Since then, all of his assets have been frozen and he has been represented by public defenders. The lengthy prison term does not bode well for Stanford, who was severely beaten by another inmate while waiting for trial in jail. He was hospitalized and later transferred to a federal prison medical facility in Butner, North Carolina, as result of an addiction to anti-depressants, which he developed after the beating.

Traveling in style: Stanford's 120-foot yacht called the Sea Eagle is seen docked in Christiansted, St. Croix . His defense team had claimed that the trauma left their client unable to remember anything, but government psychiatrist eventually determined that the financier was faking it and set a trial date. Stanford was once considered one of the wealthiest men in the U.S., with an estimated personal net worth of more than $1.9billion, a $7.7million mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Croix, a moated mansion in Miami, which he called Tyecliffe Castle, and a 120-foot yacht named the Sea Eagle. His financial empire stretched from the U.S. to Latin America and the Caribbean. Calling Stanford arrogant and without remorse, prosecutors said he used the money from investors who bought certificates of deposit, or CDs, from his bank in Antigua to fund a string of failed businesses, bribe regulators and pay for a lavish lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of private jets and sponsorship of cricket tournaments.

From prince to pauper: The man who was once transporting chests filled with cash in his helicopter (left) has been declared indigent and having to rely on court-appointed lawyers . Stanford added moments before being led away: ‘If I live the rest of my life in prison...I will always be at peace with the way I conducted myself in business.’ The majority of the victims were small businesses or private investors, looking to cash-in on interest rates above bank rate. Mike Bishop, of Houston, Texas, who lost round $1.4million, said outside the court:  ‘This was a wholesale failure by government agencies who regulate companies such as Stanford. They are as responsible. King of Con: Stanford has been compared to infamous financier Bernard Madoff, who is currently serving a 150-year prison term for a $50billion Ponzi scheme . ‘Here in Texas, we believe in capital punishment but I would not wish it on Stanford, I want him to wake up every morning in his prison cell and reflect on what he did to us all.’ In June of 2008, Stanford signed a controversial deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for a series of five Twenty20 cricket games between England and a Caribbean side nicknamed the ‘Stanford All-Stars.’ The winners would collect a prize-fund of £13.6-million and the losers would get nothing. During the tournament, Stanford was pictured sitting with the England players wives, at one sitting bouncing the wife of wicketkeeper Matt Prior on his knee. His next trick was to fly into Lords cricket field in London aboard a personalized helicopter laden with treasure chests filled with cash. He . planned to be the savior of English cricket, even though he admitted he . never really understood the game. By . the time of his arrest, in February of 2009, the ECB has severed all ties . with Stanford and his honorary knighthood - a Caribbean title provided by Antigua which he misleadingly claimed was bestowed upon him by the Queen Elizabeth II - had been stripped. The . jury that convicted Stanford also cleared the way for U.S. authorities . to go after about $329million in stolen investor funds sitting in the . financier’s frozen foreign bank accounts in London, Canada and . Switzerland. Three other . former Stanford executives are scheduled for trial in September.

Prosecutors said Stanford had treated his victims like 'roadkill.' They had asked for a prison sentence spanning more than two centuries, calling him a 'ruthless predator' who stole from investors 'simply to satisfy his own greed and vanity.' He even claimed to be related to the . founder of the elite Stanford University in California until it denied . any relationship and then filed a trademark infringement against him for . misusing its good name. But Stanford’s pretense at old-money . grandeur is nothing new. His wedding in Susan’s home town of Teague, . Texas, on a hot September evening in 1975 was reported in the local . newspaper as if it were a dynastic match, with the bride adorned in . ‘Venice lace, lavishly appliqued on white English net’. Teague, however, turned out to be a dusty rural town on the scorched cattle prairie of Texas. Susan’s father was a train conductor and her parents own a simple . bungalow on a street where their nearest neighbor lives in a trailer. In 2009, The Mail on Sunday reported that besides his wife of more than three decades, Susan, from whom Stanford got separated, he had several mistresses who were known as his ‘outside wives.’ He has had at least four children with these women. At the time, Stanford’s then-81-year-old father, James Stanford, said: ‘I felt bad for Susan, him having all these outside wives and all these kids. I wouldn’t have approved of it but I heard about it after the fact.’ Susan was a dental hygienist and Stanford, whose father inherited an insurance business, ran a chain of health clubs. His mother was a nurse. By the time he made his first fortune in Texas real estate in the 1980s, Stanford was already an accomplished womanizer. ‘He met his first outside wife through the business,’ his father said. The Mail on Sunday has established that the tycoon has a son, Reid Allen Stanford, by a woman who goes by the name of Susan Stanford-Mahan. Another outside wife, Beki Reeves-Stanford, lives on the smart Florida island of Key Biscayne. According to public records, she had a son, Robert Allen Stanford Jr, in 1993 whose father is Robert Allen Stanford Sr. The third outside wife is Louise Sage, from Dartford, Kent, by whom he has two children – Ross and Allena. He introduced Ms Sage to his father. The tycoon’s long-suffering wife Susan petitioned for a divorce in November of 2007. Perhaps Allen Stanford’s undoing was that he began to believe in his own empire of lies.\n",

It has been nearly 19 years since he famously fled British justice. But yesterday Asil Nadir finally went on trial for allegedly stealing £150million to fund his luxury lifestyle. The 70-year-old is accused of plundering his Polly Peck business empire to pay for lavish properties, cars and gifts for himself and his family, causing the firm to collapse nearly 22 years ago. The tycoon, who had at his disposal . five company cars including Bentleys and a Ferrari Testarossa, as well . as a company aeroplane, then fled as fraud investigators closed in. On . the eve of his trial in May 1993 he jetted off to his native Northern . Cyprus where he set up home. It . was not until August 2010 that Nadir flew back to London and was . re-arrested. Yesterday the former fugitive entered the Old Bailey . grinning as he prepared to go into the dock for the first time to face . 13 charges of theft. Nadir . stopped to shake hands and wave at supporters after arriving in a . presidential-style cavalcade. He was flanked by minders and accompanied . by his glamorous second wife Nur, 27. The . defendant sat calmly as the court heard how he raided the firm's . accounts to splash out on a string of million pound properties and . luxuries such as a new Mercedes for his first wife Ayshegul, cash for . his son Birol and livestock for a 'model farm' on a country estate in . Leicestershire. He even used the stolen cash to pay off his tax bill and debts, it was alleged. Nadir . is facing trial over 13 specimen counts of theft amounting to . £33million and $2.5million. But prosecutor Philip Shears, QC, said the . 'much bigger picture' was that he stole £146million and $6.4million in a . total of 64 transfers. The cash was allegedly taken between August 1987 and August 1990 from three accounts held by Polly Peck International (PPI), a major international conglomerate which had more than 200 subsidiaries trading in food, electronics, textiles and leisure and housed the Del Monte fruit business. Nadir is said to have ordered his henchmen to take out bags of bank notes, often totalling £100,000, from banks which he 'dishonestly routed away to benefit himself, his family or associates'. Mr Shears told jurors: 'Mr Nadir was chairman and chief executive of PPI. He was a man who wielded very considerable power over its operations and management and that of its subsidiaries, particularly in Northern Cyprus. In the dock: A court drawing shows Nadir on the opening day of his trial, where the Old Bailey heard he stole £150m from his business empire . 'Dishonest': Nadir and his wife Nur at court, where Nadir is on trial over allegations he stole £34million . 'We say he abused that power and helped himself to tens of millions of pounds of PPI's money. 'The time span of the counts is . between 1987 and 1990. That is a long time ago. Why are we trying . matters so long ago? The answer is simple. He was due to stand his trial . in late 1993 but in May of 1993 he fled the country to Northern Cyprus, . thus leaving the jurisdiction, only to return in August 2010. 'The funds were used in a variety of ways for the benefit of Nadir himself, his family and his associates.' Exit: Nadir leaves court this evening following the conclusion of the day's proceedings at the Old Bailey . The jury heard that Nadir hid . £7.5million he siphoned off from his firm in his mother, Safiye's, bank . accounts. The rest of the stolen cash went through a complex series of . transactions through companies in Switzerland and the Bahamas and a bank . he owned in Northern Cyprus, it was said. When the company folded owing more . than £550million, administrators found that the vast majority of cash . was held in Northern Cyprus. By December 1989, £202.6million – 81 . per cent of all Polly Peck's cash balances – was held by its Turkish and . Northern Cyprus companies. By the end of June 1990 this had risen to . £305.8million. When questioned about the cash . transfers, Nadir allegedly told his board it made good business sense . and that he needed to pay citrus growers for produce. Shortly before the firm collapsed in . October 1990, Nadir increased his salary from £200,000 to £350,000, the . court heard. Mr Shears said: 'When the administrators went to Northern . Cyprus they effectively found no cash at all, just a black hole. We say . there is a perfectly good explanation for that – it had gone. Mr Nadir . had stolen it.' The jury heard that Nadir was the . dominant force in the company which he built up from an ailing textiles . firm in the early 1980s. Mr Shears said: 'He directed its . affairs in an autocratic manner and refused to tolerate rival sources of . power in the management or to accept constraints upon his freedom of . action.' Unlike other businesses, PPI operated . with a single signatory system where only one member of the board could . authorise the transfer of funds as Nadir refused to 'surrender the power . to transfer funds'. But he relied on help from his alleged . accomplice, Elizabeth Forsyth, his 'personal financial officer' who was . managing director of South Audley Management (SAM) which ran most of . the money transactions. Jason Davies, another director of SAM, also . 'provided assistance to Nadir in his dishonest enterprise', the court . heard. They allegedly worked together to help . Nadir use PPI money to secretly buy £26.2million in PPI shares to prop . up its share price, which allowed the company to borrow more from banks, . helped maintain the value of Nadir's own shareholding and prevented . lenders forcing the sale of his personal stock. The court heard that Nadir also used the cash to invest in businesses he owned or controlled. They included a newspaper and . publishing company in Northern Cyprus, a Swiss computer firm he used to . get a Swiss residence permit, a Turkish airline, Baggrave Farm – a . country estate in  Leicestershire – and Burley on the Hill, a hotel . development project in Rutland. Nadir, of Belgravia, denies 13 counts of theft. The trial continues.\n",

Human beings are surprisingly bad at spotting deception - perhaps because we do so much of it - but one group are VERY good... liars themselves. In a speaking test, liars were able to spot other liars far more accurately than people who told the truth - which might explain why poker players are good at both. Oddly, the ability ISN'T related to IQ or emotional intelligence - the ability to lie is a separate thing. University College, London, researchers graded 51 volunteers simultaneously on their abilities to tell lies - and spot other liars. Graphing the results, it's clear that people who are good at TELLING lies can also spot them far more easily than 'normal' people. There are clear 'tells' that people are lying - such as the fact that they tend to take longer to start talking, which the research confirmed, but liars pick up on these more easily. 'It is not uncommon to hearof ‘poachers turned gamekeepers’, such as infamous confidence-trickster,Frank AbagnaleJr., who is now an FBI financial fraud consultant,' say the researchers. What is more mystifying is that the liars and non-liars are of similar intelligence level - ie it's not a simple difference in intellectual ability. The ability to deceive seems to be separate - although it's not clear whether people are born with it, or learn it. 'A significant relationship was found between the deception-related . abilities; those who could accurately detect a lie were able to produce . statements that others found difficult to classify as deceptive or . truthful,' say the researchers. 'Furthermore, neither ability was related to measures of . intelligence or emotional ability.

A conman who was caught in a sting on the TV show Cowboy Builders has been jailed for five years after ripping off a string of customers for more than £370,000. Builder John Guerin, who featured on the Channel 5 show presented by Dominic Littlewood in January 2011, was jailed at Croydon Crown Court after pleading guilty to 10 charges of fraud and one of obtaining money by deception. The court heard how the 56-year-old, from Biggin Hill, Kent, targeted vulnerable people and that after starting work, he convinced customers to hand over as much cash as possible before he vanished. Guerin's tactics saw him try to get 'at least' 90 per cent of the quoted price before he did a runner - leaving dozens of homes across London in a 'state of ruin' and in need of emergency structural work between 2006 and 2010. Behind bars: John Guerin, pictured during his appearance on the Channel 5 TV show Cowboy Builders in January 2011, has been jailed for five years . Poor workmanship: An example of the shoddy work carried out by jailed conman John Guerin . Many of the homes he targeted were left with gaping holes in walls, skips lying full and unpaid for in the driveway, and dodgy electrics and plumbing. Some were left in such a dangerous condition they were in peril of collapsing and homeowners had to stump up tens of thousands to get professional builders in to complete the job before they could move back in. The court also heard how many owners had to re-mortgage their homes in order to pay for builders to come in and fix Guerin's shoddy work. Many of Guerin's crimes took place in the London Borough of Bromley. After he was jailed, Bromley Borough Council released photos of some of his shoddy building work. The council said Guerin traded under a range of company names, including Bluewood Constructions Ltd, Greyfox Project Management and Merlyn Refurbishment Ltd, before he was snared. Challenge: John Guerin, right, is confronted by TV presenter Dominic Littlewood during an episode of Cowboy Builders . Jailed: John Guerin is now behind bars after admitting ten charges of fraud . The council's trading standards department said Guerin employed the same tactic on most jobs, by giving homeowners a quote for the work and then demanding 90 per cent of the full amount before doing a runner. In one case, Guerin was asked to build an extension for a man suffering from Parkinson's disease, but left with the project in a 'total mess' after getting more than £20,000. Sentencing Guerin to five years in jail, Judge Heather Baucher said: 'It beggared belief that he would inflict such harm. 'Nothing will compensate the victims for the distress and misery caused.' The court heard how the total amount paid by victims was £370,000 - but that with the increased costs of getting the job done properly meant victims would be 'left considerably out of pocket'. Bromley Council added that it had made an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize Guerin's assets. Councillor Tim Stevens said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case and the time is now conducting a financial investigation into any financial gains made so the council can seek to recover any sums that were overpaid. 'The outcome of this case sends out a very strong message that we will not tolerate criminals preying on Bromley residents and our trading standards team is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.' During his appearance on Cowboy Builders, Guerin was challenged by Mr Littlewood about the quality of his workmanship.The show is co-presented by former glamour model Melinda Messenger.\n",

A convicted conman tried to hire hitmen to kill and decapitate the judge and young female prosecutor who put him in jail for 15 years, a court has heard. Joseph Romano, 49, offered the killers a bonus if they kept the heads in formaldehyde - a toxic chemical used to preserve dead bodies -  as souvenirs, a judge was told. Romano allegedly told an informant that he wanted to torture Judge Joseph Bianco and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Gatz before they were killed. Romano wanted Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Gatz, left, and Judge Bianco, right, tortured and killed after he was put in jail for 15 years . The informant reported the threat to the FBI, the authorities said yesterday. FBI special agent Reynaldo Tariche said in court papers: 'Romano requested that the heads of both the judge and the [prosecutor] be preserved in formaldehyde as souvenirs.' 'Romano was willing to pay extra . for the \"souvenirs\" if [the undercover] was willing to store them until . Romano’s release from prison.' Romano appeared emotionless at a brief court appearance in Central Islip, New York, yesterday. The FBI also arrested Dejvid . Mirkovic, a business associate of Romano, and charged him with acting as . the intermediary between two undercover FBI agents posing as hitmen, . according to court papers. Romano had pleaded guilty in 2010 to wire and bank fraud in connection with a 'boiler room scheme' in which victims were offered collectible coins at vastly inflated prices. There were more than 1,500 victims — most of them elderly investors who lost their life savings, it was reported in the New York Daily News. In total they were fleeced out of more than $40million. Authorities said Romano made about $4million. Romano, 49, had pleaded guilty in 2010 to wire and bank fraud in connection with a 'boiler room scheme' in which victims were offered collectible coins at vastly inflated prices . Last month, the judge signed a $7million forfeiture order against him, of which he still owes the government more than $5million. Romano was sentenced to less than the 20 years maximum behind bars that he faced for wire and mail fraud. Since his conviction he was plotting for revenge against the government. Romano sought the help of the informant in finding a contract killer. The undercover agents met with him at the Nassau County jail where he was locked up during recent restitution hearings. He represented himself at the hearings. Romano proposed the undercovers assault another associate of his for $3,000 as a test, which, if successfully carried out, would lead to another 'big job, some serious work,' according to the complaint. Romano was involved in a financial dispute with the man he wanted attacked. The meeting was recorded with secret audio and video devices worn by the agent. Undercover agents told Mirkovic that the associate had been assaulted and showed him a staged photo of the attack. After hearing the news he allegedly offered them the  $40,000 contract on Bianco and Gatz. The agents were paid $12,000 as a down payment toward the . double hit and the balance was supposed to be paid after the judge and . prosecutor were killed. Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said, as reported in the New York Daily News: 'Romano thought he was buying revenge.

The family of a young Florida man who was killed in a car crash last year has been left ‘devastated' by their loss, their lawyer said. Lili and William Wilson are seeking an unspecified amount of compensation from International Polo Club Palm Beach founder John Goodman, 48 after he was accused of drunk driving in the February 2010 accident. Last fall, he adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Laruso Hutchins, who is now entitled to up to a third of his biological children's massive trust fund. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Newest family member: John Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall . Goodman’s attorney Daniel Bachi issued a statement saying that the . adoption of his girlfriend was intended to help the Trust for his . biological children, Harriet and John, Jr. He wrote: ‘The adoption of Ms Hutchins should have no effect on the . civil proceedings as none of the assets belong to Mr Goodman.’ According to Mr Bachi, Goodman’s assets are worth more than $300million. Scott Wilson, a 23-year-old graduate of the University of Central Florida, was killed in 2010 . ‘The legal adoption of Ms Hutchins does not change that in any way. Ms . Hutchins has no obligation whatsoever to give John B. Goodman a dime.’ Another contract between the two states that at least 95 per cent of the trust will ‘ultimately’ go to Harriet and John Jr. He stressed that there is nothing illegal about the adoption. The Wilsons’ lawyer Christian Searcy claims that Goodman still has a . high degree of control over his children’s trust, court papers show. Goodman is being sued by Wilson’s parents for wrongful death. According to police reports, Goodman ran a stop sign on February 10, 2010 in Wellington, Florida and smashed into Wilson, sending his car into a canal. Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post. Court papers show that Goodman adopted Ms Hutchins in October of last year, CBS12.com reported. ‘My reaction was that it was both awful and brilliant,’ Belray Beach adoption attorney Charlotte Danciu told CBS12.com. The adoption papers state that Hutchins, now a legal child of Goodman, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust. Goodman and Ms Hutchins began dating in 2009, according to her testimony. The Wilsons’ attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman is attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets. ‘It cannot go unrecognised that (Goodman) chose to adopt his 42-year-old adult girlfriend as opposed to a needy child,' he told the paper. Judge Kelley wrote that the events are taking the court ‘into a legal twilight zone.’ The trial: John Goodman's lawyer said in court that the adoption has nothing to do with his pending criminal trial . Wreckage: Goodman is charged with driving while intoxicated and vehicular manslaughter after police reports show he ran a stop sign and slammed into Scott Wilson's Hyundai, right . Ms Danciu agreed. ‘Unless you intend to create the parent-child relationship, you are violating the letter of the law,’ she told CBS12.com. Arrested: John Goodman faces a criminal trial in March for the DUI death of Wilson . Scott Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer. He had been driving his Hyundai home . to Wellington to visit his family, according to the Palm Beach New Times . when he was struck by Goodman's Bentley convertible after he ran a stop sign. Wilson's car was knocked into a nearby canal, where he drowned. Goodman was found to have a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit after the fatal 2010 crash, police reports show. He will be criminally tried March 6, facing charges of DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and leaving the scene of a crash. He could spend up to 30 years in prison if found guilty, the Palm Beach Post reports. The civil trial will be some weeks later on March 27. Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told myfoxorlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more. ‘It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said. Goodman’s father was the late Harold Goodman, who built a fortune from a heating and air conditioning manufacturing business. His family sold the business in 2004 for a reported $1.4 billion. He converted his father’s horse farm into a polo ranch and later began building his empire. His club became a magnate for the rich and famous, entertaining the likes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Sylvester Stallone, and Charlton Heston. Even Madonna was spotted at the club, attending an International Polo Club match in 2009. Goodman’s wealth is a point of a heated dispute. The Palm Beach New Times questioned the heir’s true assets, quoting Mr Wilson’s lawyer. Attorney Chris Searcy said Goodman is much richer than his financial documents show. He is seeking punitive damages that will ‘sting (Goodman) badly without bankrupting him,’ Mr Searcy told the New Times. Celebrity hot spot: John Goodman and Hilary Duff, left, pose with an elephant At International Polo Club annual Polo Ball black-tie gala in 2007 . According to the website, Mr Searcy thinks Goodman’s wealth is buried in numerous trusts and companies, and is as ‘sophisticated’ a method as he’s ever seen. The financial battle has been closely tied to the wrongful death suit. In 2002, the mogul sold his Wellington estate to his children’s trust fund for $3.8million, according to the New Times. But he only rents it for $2,000 per month. According to an August 2011 report by the Palm Beach Post, his two children have more than $200 million in their trust funds. Mr Searcy suspects he has full control over those trusts. Mr Searcy also said in court that Goodman has an airplane, yacht, polo ponies, and an unspecified amount of his father’s $1.4billion fortune from Goodman Manufacturing.

In a 2006 document, Goodman claimed one of his trusts was worth more than $100 million. Mr Searcy pointed out that Goodman claimed in 2011 that trust was only worth $6.9 million. The Wilsons have already settled privately with the Player’s Club, a bar in Wellington where Goodman had been drinking in February 2010. They claimed that the club was partially responsible for the crash because they served Goodman even though he was intoxicated. Lifestyles of the rich and famous: Goodman owns the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida . The bartenders deposed that Goodman wasn’t noticeably drunk. Goodman divorced his first wife Isla Carroll in 2008 after 22 years of marriage. In the April 2009 divorce filing, Ms Carroll said she was fearful for the safety of herself as well as her children. Jeanne T. Tate, a fellow of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, has been practicing adoption law for nearly 30 years. She told MailOnline that while nothing illegal was done when John Goodman adopted his girlfriend, she’s seen many cases where adoption ‘is used for purposes other than what you’d traditionally think it was intended.’ In Florida, adult adoptions do not have the same requirements as traditional child adoptions. She explained: ‘A lot of the traditional adoption statutes- including home studies – those protections are eliminated when you’re adopting an adult, with less government intrusion being the goal.’ She said the only people who have to consent in an adult adoption are the adoptee and the adopter. Under Florida law, they do have to give notice of the adoption, though Ms Tate notes that parental consent is not required. ‘The court may not have been aware of many things,’ she said, ‘including that there was a pending wrongful death suit, or that she was a girlfriend.’ When asked if is now legal for Goodman to have sex with his daughter, Ms Tate responded: ‘That’s a good question. I’m not a criminal lawyer, but it’s a solid question to wonder about.’ She said that because they’re both adults and not biologically related, the question’s answer is murky. ‘Creepy,’ she said,’ but I don’t know if that’s illegal.’ Attorney Wayne Richter told MailOnline that under Florida law, the statutory has no law against having sex with an adopted child as long as there is no lineal consanguinity - meaning there is no close blood tie, such as aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew. Ms Tate said that should Goodman wish to marry Ms Hutchins after the criminal case, it would be a difficult endeavour. The statute, she said, is permanent in the eyes of the law. ‘Even for fraud of duress, you have to bring the challenges in front of the court.’ In Florida, all adoption papers are sealed and cannot be viewed by reporters or third parties. ‘A court could order the file open,’ Ms Tate said,’ but it is difficult to do’ – in most cases because of the sensitive nature of protecting identities. Ms Hutchins could in theory, with the consent of Goodman, be re-adopted by her parents and then marry him, Ms Tate said.During Goodman’s civil case, Ms Tate said the court could open the adoption file and examine if there was any fraud on the court or the adoptee (Ms Hutchins). She added: ‘There’s nothing illegal, per se, about adopting your girlfriend.’ Watch the video here: .\n",

One of his programs scanned through 200,000 accounts registered to online payment service PayPal - identifying names, passwords and current balances. Pearson, an 'incredibly talented' boarding school student who carried out the crime for an ‘intellectual . challenge’, has been jailed for two years and two months. Fraudster: Edward Pearson, 23, stole the personal details of more than eight million people. Pearson's girlfriend Cassandra Mennim, 21, tried to pay for luxury hotels using stolen credit card details . He also managed to shut down part of the mobile phone giant Nokia’s internal network for two weeks after hacking in and copying the details of over 8,000 members of staff, Southwark Crown Court heard. His 21-year-old girlfriend, Cassandra Mennim, a sociology student at the University of York, triggered a police inquiry after she tried to pay for luxury hotel stays using stolen credit card details. Pearson was arrested after investigators linked a web alias, ‘G-Zero’, which had appeared on hacking forums, to his personal email address. On one of his computers officers found 8,110,474 names, dates of birth, and postcodes for adults living in the UK. Police officers in the case said that if the details were printed onto double-sided A4 it would fill a staggering 67,500 sheets. David Hughes, prosecuting, said the hacker had carried out a series of ‘sophisticated, planned frauds.' He said: ‘Pearson used his considerable expertise for his criminal intentions. ‘When police examined other computers they found the details of 2,701 credit or debit cards. ‘Based on the average fraud used on a single card being £309, the potential gain to be made by him was £834,000. ‘In fact the actual fraud on these . credit and debit cards attributed to Pearson amounted to £2,351, but the . total on the cards was £39,832.’ The details were all stolen over an 18-month period between January 1, 2010, and August 30, 2011. Pearson coded trojan viruses, called Zeus, SpyEye and Python, to automatically scour the internet in search of personal details. His Python program successfully downloaded the details of 200,000 PayPal accounts. Mr . Hughes added that Pearson had hacked into the systems of Nokia and web . giant AOL to gain access to their employees’ details, as well as other . sensitive information. ‘This . had a significant negative impact on the company, which had to shut its . networks down for two weeks while checks were carried out on it,’ he . said. Mennim was caught after booking rooms . at the Cedar Court Grand Hotel and Lady Anne Middleton Hotel, both in . York, using stolen credit card details and PayPal accounts. Andrew Bodnar, defending Pearson, said his hacking had not been for financial gain, but more as an intellectual challenge. ‘This . is a young man who has very advance computer skills, but has put them . to the wrong use, but he is not the criminal mastermind that everyone . claims he is. ‘The total amount of money he fraudulently amounted, is the figure of £2,351. Pearson's girlfriend Cassandra Mennim tried to pay for a luxury hotel stay at the Cedar Court Grand Hotel in York . Mennim also used PayPal details to tell staff she would pay for an expensive stay at Lady Anne Middleton's Hotel, in York . ‘These have been done using the Paypal accounts, to order pizza and other takeaway foods, and to pay for mobile phone accounts. ‘It . is fair to say that he produced the Trojan, Zeus and other software as . an intellectual challenge, and he hacked into Nokia to see if he could.’ He added that although he had shared some of the details, he had never sold them. Shut down: Mobile phone giant Nokia was shut down by Pearson for two weeks after he hacked in to their network and copied the details of more than 8,000 members of staff, Southwark Crown Court heard . Stephen Grattage, defending Mennim, who gained 9 A's and 4 A*’s at GCSEs, said she was a vulnerable young women who had found comfort in Pearson following a difficult previous relationship. ‘She stands before the court, saying she is ashamed of herself, and she is ashamed of her actions and is very sorry. ‘She says she will pay back the money that she owes to the hotel.’ Sentencing Pearson to two years and two months and handing Mennim a 12 month supervision order the judge Ms Recorder Ann Mulligan said: ‘It is extremely regrettable that you two promising young individuals find yourself in the dock. ‘This was a very sophisticated crime, in which you managed to access highly confidential information and put many many individuals at risk of attack. ‘You had a staggering amount of personal details, 8.1 million, which included names, dates of births, credit and debit card details and security codes, the use of which they could have been used for, is hard to imagine. ‘Your computers and software were a devastating tool kit. ‘I accept that you didn’t sell this information, but you shared it with other computer programmers, and you had no way of knowing how they might use this information. Victim: Online payment provider PayPal was hacked into by computer expert Edward Pearson . ‘This stupendous criminality was not about financial gain, but about an intellectual challenge.’ Pearson, originally from Blandford Forum, Dorset, and now of Lendale, York, admitted making an article for use in fraud and two counts of possession of an article for use in fraud. Mennim, of Balmoral Terrace, South Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, admitted two counts of obtaining services dishonestly.\n",

A Texan tycoon who defrauded almost £5 billion from investors and used his wealth to bankroll international cricket matches in England was jailed for 110 years yesterday. Allen Stanford, who for 22 years ran investment scams with an estimated 17,000 victims, was once one of the richest men in America, worth more than £1.2 billion. The courtroom in Houston was packed with many of his victims to hear the sentence handed down, the majority of whom were small business owners. Two of the estimated 17,000 victims of Stanford’s fraud were allowed to address the court. Jailbird: Convicted financier Allen Stanford arrives at Federal Court in Houston for sentencing . Jaime Escalona, who represented Latin . American victims, addressed the hearing before turning to stare directly . at Stanford to tell him: 'You, sir, are a dirty, rotten, scoundrel.' The other victims’ spokesman, Angela . Shaw, of the Stanford Victims Coalition, said of the fraudster: “Allen . Stanford has stolen more than billions of dollars. He took our lives as . we knew them.” She said some 28,000 people had lost money in the scam. Yet, even in his final hour of shame . the former tycoon couldn’t help but deny it all and to blame others. 'I’m not a thief.....I did not defraud anybody,' he said. 'The US government are responsible . ruining the business....they destroyed it and turned it to nothing. Stanford was a real brick-and-mortar global financial empire.' Guilty: Stanford was convicted in March of 13 of 14 counts of fraud . Stanford now plans to appeal against the conviction and sentence even though he was officially declared “indigent” – penniless. The court has now to appoint lawyers . who will be funded out of a scheme similar to Britain’s own legal-aid . and it is estimated to run into tens of millions of dollars. During yesterday’s sentencing, . Stanford’s 40-minute rambling account was the first time he had actually . spoken to the court about what had taken place during the 22-years his . banking empire existed. He claimed he was a scapegoat and . blamed the federal government and a court-appointed receiver who took . over his companies in 2009 for tearing down his business empire and . preventing his investors from getting any of their money back. He said: “ I’m not here to ask for . sympathy or forgiveness or to throw myself at your mercy but I will tell . you I did not run a Ponzi scheme. I didn’t defraud anybody.” Stanford was once considered one of . the richest men in the U.S., with an estimated personal net worth of . more than £1.2billion. His financial empire stretched from the U.S. to . Latin America and the Caribbean. Calling Stanford arrogant and without . remorse, prosecutors said he used the money from investors who bought . certificates of deposit, or CDs, from his bank in Antigua to fund a . string of failed businesses, bribe regulators and pay for a lavish . lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of private jets and sponsorship . of cricket tournaments. Stanford added moments before being . led away: “If I live the rest of my life in prison …. I will always be . at peace with the way I conducted myself in business.” Disgraced tycoon Stanford’s schemes . were the second largest in US financial history – second only to Bernie . Madoff, the so-called ‘King of Con’ - who was given 150 years for his . £11.2-billion Ponzi scheme. The majority of the victims were small businesses or private investors, looking to cash-in on interest rates above bank rate.

Happier times: Allen Stanford poses with Stanford Superstars following their victory at the end of the Stanford 20/20 Super Series match between England and Stanford Superstars in 2008 . Mike Bishop, of Houston, Texas, who . lost round £900,000 said outside the court: “ This was a wholesale . failure by government agencies who regulate companies such as Stanford. They are as responsible. “Here in Texas we believe in capital . punishment but I would not wish it on Stanford, I want him to wake up . every morning in his prison cell and reflect on what he did to us all.” Stanford, ever the showman, entered the courtroom dressed in green prison fatigues and grinning all over his face. When handcuffs were taken off he waved . to his elderly mother Sammie Stanford who sat in the well of the court . alongside Stanford’s daughter Randi. Prosecutors had asked the court for a . sentence of 230 years in prison. The prosecutor told Judge David . Hittner: “ 230 years will not get anyone their money back but on . sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum.” In June 2008 Stanford signed a . controversial deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for a . series of five Twenty20 cricket games between England and a Caribbean . side nicknamed the ‘Stanford All-Stars.’ The winners would collect a . prize-fund of £13.6-million and the losers would get nothing.

Pensioner, Ian Kelsey stole more than £750,000 from his employer to splash out on flash cars, jewellery and holidays . A finance director who stole more than £750,000 from his employer to fund a lavish lifestyle including £10,000 holidays has been jailed for four years. Ian Kelsey siphoned off an average of £100,000 a year, over seven years, from the accounts of AM Todd, an American oil supplier. He took up to £48,000 in a single transaction after discovering he had final authority over all payments. The disgraced employee, from Wells, Somerset, used the cash to fund a 'high standard of living' including expensive holidays, jewellery for his wife and a fleet of new cars. Kelsey was jailed at Taunton Crown Court after admitting 24 charges of transfer by deception and fraud. Mr Recorder Paul Dunkels QC said the fraud was particularly grave given the degree of trust that had been placed in role as financial director. The judge said: 'You were responsible for arranging payment and the reclaiming of VAT and in the course of this duty you discovered that you alone could sanction payment. 'You embarked upon a course of repeated theft and fraud. 'This was a very grave breach of trust having regard to the degree of trust placed in you and the number of long years you did it for. 'I have of course given you credit for being a man of previous good character but here you are at the age of 67 having lost that and facing imprisonment for the first time in your life. 'I sentence you to four years imprisonment, you will serve half and be on license for the remainder.' Kelsey used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle of expensive holidays to Cyprus, jewellery and Mazda cars . He added that on average Kelsey stole over £100,000 a year to fund his lavish lifestyle and that there was no realistic prospect of the total £776,538.41 being repaid. Kelsey first began to steal from AM Todd, based in Frome, Somerset, in 2003 after he started transferring highly-inflated VAT re-claims into his Halifax bank account. Nigel Askham, prosecuting, told the court that suspicion had been cast after an HMRC official began to notice discrepancies in the claims between December 19th 2003 and February 23rd 2010. Ian Kelsey was jailed for 4 years at Taunton Crown Court . He said: 'When the official tried to arrange a visit to inspect the business Mr Kelsey was less than helpful. 'When they finally caught up it was obvious he was in complete panic, he was red faced and at one point he even ran off. 'It was discovered that he was transferring inflated VAT re-claims from the HMRC to A M Todd’s Sterling account into his own bank account. 'He funded his high standard of living, taking £10,000 holidays to Cyprus and buying many Mazda cars, over the years.' Rebecca Bradbury, mitigating, said that Kelsey had begun transferring the large sums of money after his hours and wages had been cut. She said that he had initially only transferred a small amount but on realising there was no second authority checking the transactions he took advantage and increased the amounts. He used the money to buy jewellery for his now ex-wife, who has been forced to hand back much of it during civil proceedings to reclaim the money. Miss Bradbury added: 'Once he had begun to buy his family nice things his family fell into this expectation and he didn’t wish to disappoint anyone. 'He didn’t think through the consequences, once he found he could make these transactions all thought left him and he couldn’t explain where the money had gone.' She added that he was genuinely sorry for what he had done and showed deep remorse and regret. The pensioner remained emotionless as he was led from the court room to the cells.\n",

Police were called and discovered that they had been involved in forging and using first class rail tickets and railway car park passes. Old tickets had been scanned on to a computer and the date changed. Their scam involved copying a first class monthly season ticket from Southampton to London Waterloo worth £849.50 and a monthly railway car park ticket costing £130. The three previously well-respected men – Neil Stantiall, construction firm boss John McInally and building worker Mark Batt – have now been given suspended jail sentences for their part in the fraud, which involved dodging more than £2,000 of rail fares and parking fees.

A City trader accused of the biggest banking fraud in British corporate history appeared in court for the start of his trial. Kweku Adoboli, 32, allegedly gambled away £1.5bn on the stock markets while working for Swiss Bank UBS. He faces two counts of fraud and two counts of false accounting having been accused of losing the money as a result of a series of unauthorised trades.

The Internal Revenue Service has today awarded a jailed tax cheat whistleblower and former UBS AG bank employee Bradley Birkenfeld $104 million for handing over insider information into the Swiss bank's promotion of secret offshore accounts to U.S. taxpayers. Lawyers for the Boston-born banker said that they believed that the sum is the largest reward ever handed to one whistleblower in the U.S. and the IRS confirmed that amount had been given to Mr. Birkenfeld, but refused to say whether it was the largest award to date. The money was awarded to Mr. Birkenfeld after he told U.S. authorities about illicit banking practices that were encouraged by the Swiss banking giant that led to UBS paying $780 million in fines and agreeing to hand over information on more than 4,000 Swiss bank account holders to avoid a criminal case. Scroll Down for Video . $104 million man: Bradley Birkenfeld talks to the press before surrendering to authorities at the Schuylkill County Federal Correctional Institution in Minersville, Pennsylvania in January 2010 . The 47-year-old former banker wasn't at the press conference held by his attorney's. He has only been recently released after serving part of a 40-month sentence after pleading guilty to withholding information about his own role in the Swiss bank scheme, specifically his relationship with a California property developer. Mr. Birkenfeld took advantage of a 2006 law passed by Congress that awards whistleblowers up to 30 percent of the revenue they help to recover with the information that they supply to the IRS. Bradley Birkenfeld makes remarks before surrendering to authorities at the Schuylkill County Federal Correctional Institution in Minersville, Pennsylvania before his prison sentence began in 2010 from which he has just been released . The 2006 law sponsored by Republican Senator, Charles Grassley targets high-income tax dodgers, guaranteeing rewards for qualified whistleblowers if the company in question owes at least $2 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. The $104 million that has been handed to Mr. Birkenfeld is taxable experts said to the Wall Street Journal and speculated that the attorney's fees could range from 15 percent to 35 percent of the pretax award. 'The IRS today sent 104 million messages to whistleblowers around the world — that there is now a safe and secure way to report tax fraud and that the IRS is now paying awards,' Birkenfeld's lawyers, Stephen M. Kohn and Dean A. Zerbe, said in a statement. 'The IRS also sent 104 million messages to banks around the world — stop enabling tax cheats or you will get caught.' The IRS, which doesn't usually confirm individual award payments, said Birkenfeld signed a disclosure waiver, allowing the agency to confirm his award. 'The IRS believes that the whistleblower statute provides a valuable tool to combat tax non-compliance, and this award reflects our commitment to the law,' IRS spokeswoman Michele Eldridge said in an email. Birkenfeld has become something of a cause-celebre among whistleblowers because of the magnitude of his case and the fact that he was jailed after cooperating with authorities. Former UBS employee Bradley Birkenfeld in an undated photograph. The Internal Revenue Service has awarded the ex-banker $104 million for providing information about overseas tax cheats . In a summary of the award provided by Birkenfeld's lawyers, the IRS said, 'The comprehensive information provided by the whistleblower was exceptional in both its breadth and depth.' 'While the IRS was aware of tax compliance issues related to secret bank accounts in Switzerland and elsewhere, the information provided by the whistleblower formed the basis for unprecedented actions against UBS AG, with collateral impact on other enforcement activities and a continuing impact on future compliance by UBS AG,' the IRS said in the summary. Federal prosecutors, however, had said Birkenfeld withheld information about his own dealings with a former UBS client who pleaded guilty in 2007 to tax charges. In a case that shook Swiss banking to its core, UBS in 2009 entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and paid $780 million in fines, penalties, interest and restitution to settle charges that it helped 17,000 U.S. clients hide $20 billion. U.S. authorities are still investigating other Swiss banks. As the U.S. government struggles with a massive budget deficit, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said as a result of the information provided by Birkenfeld, 'billions of dollars in taxes owed will be collected that otherwise would not have been paid.' A typical Swiss bank account is traditionally one of the most secretive options for storing money and of avoiding tax . Grassley has in the past criticized the IRS whistleblower program, which gathers information from people who want to alert the tax-collecting agency to misconduct. Grassley, a Republican, wrote a bill in 2006 that overhauled the program. Last year, the whistleblower program collected only $48 million in tax revenues, down from $464 million in fiscal 2010. New whistleblower cases were down, as well, with some lawyers complaining that the program office was slow and uncooperative with whistleblowers. Grassley said the case showed the whistleblower program can be effective, but he criticized the IRS for taking nearly four years to settle with Birkenfeld. 'If the IRS is serious about encouraging future whistleblowers, it needs to continue to honor the spirit and intent of the law and issue awards in a timely manner.' In 2009 UBS entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and paid $780 million in fines, penalties, interest and restitution to settle charges that it helped 17,000 U.S. clients hide $20 billion. U.S. authorities are still investigating other Swiss banks . Bradley Birkenfeld (left) walks down the steps of the federal courthouse with his lawyer David E. Meier after he was sentenced to 40 months in prison by the judge on August 21, 2009 - three years before benefiting from the 2006 law sponsored by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (right) The sum paid by the IRS to Birkenfeld is 'the largest whistleblower reward issued to a single individual,' said Stephen Kohn, one of the former banker's lawyers. Dean Zerbe, another Birkenfeld attorney, said his client's actions have brought in $5 billion in taxes from 'big banks and wealthy individuals who tried to evade paying their fair share.' The U.S. crackdown on Americans dodging taxes in Switzerland has spawned a diplomatic showdown between the two countries. In 2010, UBS agreed to disclose 4,450 American client names. Eleven Swiss banks are known still to be under investigation by the United States and the Swiss have been seeking a legal deal to remove the taint from their financial industry. The Birkenfeld case could prompt a backlash from the financial industry and its U.S. allies, said Solomon Wisenberg, a partner at law firm Barnes & Thornburg. 'The response could be for the friends of big business in Congress to argue this is an outrage that someone involved in this could get this kind of award,' he said. 'But if ever there was anyone who deserved a big reward it was this guy. He's done something no one's ever done before, essentially brought the Swiss banks to their knees,' said Wisenberg.

V.M. worked for Annie George (pictured) and her late husband at their 20,000-square-foot mansion . A woman accused of keeping an illegal immigrant as a servant at her upstate New York mansion says the housekeeper has become a prosecution witness in an effort to get legal status to remain in the United States. But prosecutors say the woman, who faces a federal felony, kept her emigre servant overworked, underpaid and essentially captive for several years. Both sides agree the housekeeper, identified in court papers only as V.M., a middle-aged widow from India, worked for Annie George, her late husband and six children for five years. Immigration investigators removed her in May 2011 after her son in India called the National Human Trafficking Resources Center, which says it has identified hundreds of similar U.S. cases. Bradley Miles, executive director of the nonprofit Polaris Project, which runs the 24-hour phone service, said the most frequently reported type of labor trafficking the organization hears about on the hotline are domestic servitude cases. Since 2008, it has received more than 2,500 calls directly from survivors of sex and labor trafficking, and about 60 or 70 daily looking for referrals, resources, training or 'crisis calls', he said. 'I feel it's just the tip of the iceberg,' Miles said. They try to determine if there are specific indicators of force, fraud or coercion and since 2008 have recorded 340 domestic servitude situations 'with high indicators' that the cases constitute human trafficking. The callers are referred to a network of nonprofits and police across the country. Miles said other highly publicized household forced labor cases over the past decade involved emigres from the Philippines, Indonesia and Egypt. His organization is guided by a federal definition of human trafficking from the 2000 federal law and looks for types of control that include violence, threats, isolation or holding debt over someone's head. The 40-year-old George, who faces trial on August 27, is accused of harboring an illegal immigrant for private financial gain, a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. U.S. District Judge Gary Sharpe dismissed the charge in July on a scheduling technicality but prosecutors got a new indictment days later. George has pleaded not guilty. Her lawyer, Mark Sacco, had requested dismissal and said he hoped prosecutors had better things to do with their time. Palatial home: V.M. worked in the George family's more than 20,000-square-foot stone mansion called Llenroc, 15 miles northwest of Albany . He also said the pay dispute, using . corrected math, was about $40,000 and could easily be settled in civil . court. Prosecutors said V.M. is due at least $240,000 in wages and . $79,000 in overtime based on the minimum wage. In . a trial brief, Sacco said V.M. had legal papers and was working with a . family in New Jersey in 2005. She left that job for a romantic . relationship that ended, leaving her homeless. Deal gone awry: The woman hired in 2006 to work for the Georges as a live-in domestic servant for $1,000 a month . She was taken in by a church - which she asked to help her find work - claimed to be a legal U.S. visitor, and was hired by George's husband, Mathai Kolath George, in 2006 to work for his family as a live-in domestic servant for $1,000 a month. She filled out no paperwork and didn't change her visa status. 'She was provided room, board and a stipend which was forwarded to her children in her home country,' Sacco wrote. 'As an avenue to secure permanent legal status in the United States for both herself and her children, she has condemned my client.' Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Belliss said V.M. is still in the United States and self-supporting at this point. She has temporary status in the country pending the outcome of the trial, he said. She also may testify at trial, along with the immigration investigators who removed her from George's home, after first being told she wasn't there. Prosecutors said V.M. was eventually pushed out a side door of the mansion without her bags, later got them and found her diary missing. They said V.M. was paid about $26,000 for more than five years of cooking, cleaning and child care every day from 5:30 a.m. to almost midnight. She spoke little English, never saw a doctor or dentist, seldom left the house and was taken to an immigration lawyer once but got no documents. She worked in the family's homes first in Catskill in the Hudson Valley, suburban Albany and then the more than 20,000-square-foot stone mansion called Llenroc, 15 miles northwest of Albany. Prosecutors could claim the mansion as the 'vehicle ... used in the commission of the offense' if George is convicted. Mathai George, a native of India who built a hotel and real estate development business in the U.S., was killed in 2009 along with his 11-year-old son and another man when their private plane crashed after takeoff.\n",

A fraudster plundered his dying friend's funeral fund, leaving the sick man to die penniless. Ciaran Hoey drank and gambled his way through £6,738 of Brendan O'Sullivan's savings after he was entrusted with the dying man's debit card to do his shopping. Hoey, who has previous convictions for defrauding workmates and a former employee, cleared out the account and left it £99 overdrawn. Mr O'Sullivan has since died penniless and his relatives were forced to foot the bill for the funeral - something he did not want to burden them with, Gloucester Crown Court was told. Hoey, originally from Dublin, Ireland, was this week jailed for two years after he admitted 18 charges of fraud. Describing the abuse of trust as 'despicable', Judge William Hart told Hoey: 'Brendan O’Sullivan was 80. He was in very poor health and he has recently died. He was a friend of yours and he had reposed a high degree of trust in you. 'You abused that trust in the most despicable way. The peace that he should have been entitled to find in his final days was contaminated by the memory of your betrayal. 'You used your access to his financial affairs to steal all his money from him - his modest life savings - and having stolen it you squandered it on yourself, on drinking, gambling and some consumer durables. 'When he died very recently the money he intended to put towards the cost of his funeral had gone. It is a case that is sad and in some ways tragic. 'It represents a breach by you of a high degree of trust. 'You had complete control over his affairs. One is tempted to say with your record: Once a fraudster, always a fraudster. You simply cannot divorce yourself from dishonesty.' Hoey and Mr O'Sullivan had been friends for between 10 and 12 years after meeting at the Russell Arms pub, where they both regulars. Hoey, originally from Dublin, Ireland, was jailed for two years at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) after admitting 18 charges of fraud . Prosecutor Julian Kesner told the court: 'Mr O’Sullivan began to suffer from very, very poor health and eventually was unable to leave home. 'He became reliant on his old friend, the defendant, who would do his shopping for him. 'To assist with the shopping Mr O’Sullivan gave the defendant his debit card and his PIN. 'Unknown to Mr O’Sullivan his friend then started taking them money from his account. 'In two months the account went from a healthy credit balance to a debit of £99. There were in that time 28 cash withdrawals starting on February 3 this year for £300. 'Shortly after February 3 Mr O’Sullivan was admitted to hospital but while he was there the defendant continued stealing his money. All of a sudden he did not figure in Mr O’Sullivan’s life much any more. 'He did not visit him in hospital and Mr O’Sullivan spent a lot of time endeavouring to contact him to get his debit card back.' 'Mr O’Sullivan's mission was to make sure . that he had enough money to cover his funeral expenses because he did . not want it to be something his family had to pay for' Mr Kesner added that the last withdrawal on March 27 was for £180 and it left the account in the red. He said: 'In total £6,738 was stolen. It was money he had accumulated very slowly over the years from his modest lifestyle and the small pension he was getting. 'In a statement he said that the money was for his family to pay for his funeral. His statement ends with him saying \"I remain deeply upset and traumatised by the whole event\". 'That statement was taken in June and Mr O’Sullivan has unfortunately recently died.' The court also heard a statement from Paul Barratt, Mr O'Sullivan's nephew, who said his uncle 'gave up on life' after discovering what Hoey had done. Mr Kesner added: 'Mr O’Sullivan’s mission was to make sure that he had enough money to cover his funeral expenses because he did not want it to be something his family had to pay for.' Sarah Jenkins, defending, said Hoey was ashamed and remorseful about what he had done - especially since recently learning that Mr O’Sullivan had now died. She added that Hoey had drink and gambling problems which were at the root of his offending, she said. However, she said, he was anxious to repay Mr O’Sullivan’s family and was prepared to cash in a pension fund from his former NHS job to raise the full amount. Ms Jenkins said: 'I hope Your Honour feels that is a genuine expression of how he feels about what happened in the final months of his friend’s life.' Hoey pleaded guilty to 18 charges of fraud against Mr O’Sullivan with a further nine offences taken into consideration. He was jailed for two years. In 2008, Hooey was jailed for 20 months . at the same court after he admitted getting a hospital porter's job by . failing to reveal his criminal past, stealing from a Christmas savings . club at work before stealing £1,150 from a cafe where he worked.\n",
      "91. By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:17 EST, 13 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:15 EST, 13 August 2012 . A bankrupt Pakistani man and his son managed to set up a business and cheat their local community out of almost £50,000 despite being in the UK illegally, a court heard. Siyed Asem, 58, and his son Syed Bukhari, 25, ran a corner shop and operated a Western Union money transfer service offering ‘excellent rates’ on transactions. But more than 20 customers who used the service to send money to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, were left thousands of pounds out of pocket. Father and son partnership: Bankrupt Siyed Asem, left, and his son Syed Bukhari, right, together stole nearly £50,000 from their customers who had requested for the cash to be transferred to India . Jailing father and son for two years . each, Judge Jamie Tabor QC described their offences against their own . Asian community in Gloucester’s Barton area as ‘despicable.’ Judge . Tabor said it was ‘extraordinary’ that the men had been able to run a . shop and set up the money transfer business when they were both illegal . overstayers and Asem was bankrupt. Asem . came to the UK on a visitor’s permit eight years ago and never left. His son was in the UK on a student permit which would not allow him to . work or run a business. Gloucester crown court heard that the service operated legitimately at first but the pair soon started stealing the money - which amounted to a total of £48,206. One of their customers, retired Khadijabbi Mulla, lost £1,000 he requested to be transferred to India to pay for his operation there. Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said: 'He was told it would take 8 weeks, which would take him close to the date of his operation. 'When he got to India he still had not received the promised PIN number to access his money. 'He . contacted a friend in Gloucester to ask him to complain and the message . he got back was that he would get a refund when he got back. Jailed: Siyed Asem and Syed Bukhari were sentenced to two years in prison at Gloucester Crown Court . 'He has never received a refund - as he puts it he has just had lots of excuses and delays.' Mrs Hennessy said another victim of the con, Fatima Kazi, paid the men £1,500 to be transferred to India to help fund the building of a mosque in her late father’s memory. Mrs Hennessy continued: 'The money never arrived.' She detailed how other customers lost money in similar transactions - Runara Begum and her husband lost almost £5,500 which was supposed to be going to Bangladesh; Rashid Salloo lost £1,000 destined for India; Yusuf Chand transferred £7,000 to India in two transactions but it never arrived. There were other customers who had transferred significant sums and either received nothing or were given very small refunds, she added. Mrs Hennessy said all the offences occurred within a few months between late 2010 and early 2011 after Bukhari applied in October 2010 to become an agent for Finit UK, a Western Union money transfer company. The application was granted and he was approved after ‘various checks had been carried out’. Mrs Hennessy told the court the fact that both men were illegal immigrants didn't appear to 'have come up on the checks'. She added that they also failed to notice that Asem had been made bankrupt in 2008. Fraud: The pair set up a Western Union money transfer service but stole thousands of pounds from customers that was meant to be sent to India . Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud - of masking false representations to customers that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange - between January and March 2011. Asem admitted 12 similar charges. Mrs Hennessy said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518. Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Bukhari had come to Britain legitimately to study to be a chartered accountant but had started working at McDonald’s to earn some money and then had opened the shop with his father. Asem had trusted his son’s business acumen and joined him in the venture but the money transfer service had quickly gone wrong because they were offering such good exchange rates that they made no profit, she said. Ms Pathan said that Western Union had checked only Bukhari’s credit rating before allowing him to set up the service. She added that both men knew they were facing deportation after their sentences and Asem was fearful of going back to Pakistan because he has health problems which are better treated here. Despite his status he has been getting free medication, she said. Jailing the men, Judge Tabor said: 'Over a period of three months you stole just under £50,000 from many members of your local community. 'That money was entrusted to you to transfer abroad for a variety of purposes including allowing people to have operations and to help with a mosque and other charitable tasks. 'People trusted you, especially you, father, because of the seniority that you held. I accept that when you started this business in November you ran it legitimately for a short period of time. 'But by the middle of January you were nothing more or less than confidence tricksters. You have done considerable damage to your community and you know it. 'These were despicable offences.' He told them police will now investigate their finances to see what can be confiscated from them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\n",

A husband and wife who used money from a fraudulent £10 million investment scheme to fund their extravagant lifestyle have been jailed. Scheming John and Linda Hirst enjoyed luxury holidays and lavish wedding celebrations in Las Vegas and Majorca with the proceeds of the Ponzi scheme which 'decent, trusting' people had poured their savings into. John Hirst was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court to nine years for his part in the fraud while his wife was told she would serve two-and-a-half years in jail for money laundering. Richard Pollett, an accountant who was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud, was jailed for six-and-a-half years. Fraudster John Hirst, seen here with his wife Linda, have been jailed for their roles in a multi-million pound investment scam . Judge Jonathan Durham-Hall QC told John Hirst and Pollett: 'You are through and through common criminals. What you did, and what makes this case of the utmost gravity, was brutal, callous and cruel. 'You are corrupt.' Judge Durham-Hall said: 'This was an appalling and shocking course of conduct in which so many were targeted and so many have, in effect, had the remainder of their lives shattered and ruined.' The judge said those targeted by the pair were mainly ordinary, hard-working people who put their pensions and savings into the scheme after being promised huge returns and a risk-free guarantee. Many were elderly or divorced and all were decent and trusting, he said. Judge Durham-Hall spoke of the men's greed and desire to live the high life in Majorca. Prison: John Hirst, left, was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court to nine years for his part in the fraud, while Richard Pollett, right, an accountant, was jailed for six-and-a-half years . 'It did involve money-laundering on a grand scale, high living, lavish lifestyle,' he said. 'It was sickening to see the display of extravagance at your wedding to Linda, where many of the investors you were defrauding were being entertained on the most grand scale with the use of their own dishonestly-acquired money.' Sentencing Linda Hirst, 62, the judge . said: 'You did, from June 2006 onwards, enjoy the most profligate of . high standards of living, jet-setting here and there, cruises here and . there, and, of course, Mr Hirst liberally showered you with money and . jewels.' John Hirst, 61, . from Brighouse, West Yorkshire, served a two-and-a-half-year prison . sentence in the early 1990s after being convicted of a similar . investment fraud involving miners’ redundancy payments. Shameless spenders: The couple held a huge £100,000 wedding . event and party at this luxury hotel in Majorca for friends and . family, using other people's money . After his release from jail, he later moved to Majorca and set up the Ponzi scheme in 2001. He presented himself as a wealthy expert investor with a background in the financial services and promised investors he would invest their money in the US Dow Jones Index, with minimum returns of 18 per cent. Instead, he used the money for his own benefit, including paying for his wedding to Linda in Las Vegas in 2006 and a lavish wedding celebration in Majorca costing around £88,000. The scheme began to fall apart in 2009 when the demands for the withdrawal of money exceeded the amount being invested. Of the £10 million invested into the scheme, only around £4 million has been repaid. The wedding planner who organised a £100,000 . celebration for fraudster John Hirst and his wife Linda said it . was the most expensive party she had ever thrown. The now-estranged couple and their adviser . Richard Pollett would rub shoulders with their victims on golf courses and at . Rotary Club dinners, all the while siphoning off money. After the case, wedding planner Julie Bussell, . who gave evidence during the trial, told how she arranged the Hirsts' £100,000-pound wedding celebration in Majorca after they had already tied the . knot in Las Vegas at a cost of more than £90,000. The court heard that during the weekend in . June 2006 guests enjoyed a golf competition, a ladies' pampering session and a . barbecue as well as the wedding party itself. John Hirst had also paid for some family . members to fly in for the celebration. She said: 'They had a . really fabulous venue in a five-star hotel. It was a really luxury wedding . with everything they wanted.' A Serious Fraud Office investigation began in November 2009 after a complaint from one of the 120 investors. Judge Durham-Hall said John Hirst also imperiled members of his own family by trying to involve them in the scheme. His solicitor son, Daniel Hirst, and Linda Hirst’s daughter, Zoe Waite, were cleared of money laundering charges at the trial earlier this year. John Hirst pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and two counts of money laundering at the beginning of the trial. Pollett, 70, from Poole, Dorset, was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. The court heard that he invested and lost his brother’s life-savings and those of his best friends and clients who trusted and respected him as a professional chartered accountant. Judge Durham-Hall said: 'You are a desperately greedy man, dazzled by John Hirst, envious of his lifestyle and wanting some for you at any cost.' Linda Hirst from Woking, Surrey, was found guilty of three counts of money laundering a total of around £750,000, and one count of evading a liability by deception. She is no longer in a relationship with John Hirst. Linda Hirst, wearing a pink zip-up . cardigan over a black top, sat impassively next to Pollett throughout . the sentencing proceedings, while John Hirst sat apart from his two . co-defendants. None of the three showed any emotion when they were jailed. Speaking . outside the court after the sentencing, Charles Dewey, one of the . investors in the scheme, described the trio as evil and said he had been . left with nothing. 'It’s had a huge effect on us really, it’s made me doubt people from a trust point of view,' Mr Dewey, from Somerset, said. 'The . destruction of trust is a very nasty lesson to learn aged 50, together . with I’m now having to start life again like a student.' He . added: 'This man has taken £300,000 from us, we’re now left with . nothing. We’ve got nothing to our name now, we’re living on benefits . with two children. It’s a very difficult situation.' He . added: 'That man has ripped our lives apart. I think they’re evil . people. I’m very relieved that, at long last, justice has been made to . bear on him.' Life of crime: John Hirst and his wife Linda spent £90,000 . of stolen cash on their wedding in Las Vegas .

A fraudster has posed as the brother of missing millionairess Carole Waugh and tried to sell her Marylebone home in London. Carole Waugh, 50, has not been seen by her family since mid-April and financial activity linked to her identity has become 'incrementally more suspicious' since then, Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said. Her brother Chris Waugh, 54, who lives . in Cumbria, said it was 'a very distressing moment' to discover the . conman had posed as him when he tried to sell the £650,000 property. Two women were arrested yesterday after police released CCTV images of two women they wanted to speak to in connection with the investigation. Carole Waugh was last seen shopping in Central London on May 4. She failed to turn up for family birthday celebrations or for the start of a new job in Malta . One man has been committed to trial charged with three counts of conspiring to commit fraud by false representation. 'Very substantial sums of money' have been stolen since the businesswoman vanished after she was last seen by relatives at a family party at Easter, police say. Detectives believe at least three . women have tried to impersonate the oil industry executive - one at the . Westfield shopping centre in west London on July 13. DCI McFarlane said: 'From the . inquiries since Carole has gone missing, we’ve established that there . have been at least three women impersonating her at various locations, . at various financial institutions and other premises. 'We know that there has been a man, . who we haven’t as yet identified, who has been impersonating Chris who . was endeavouring to raise finances and engage in the selling of her . flat.' The man was impersonating Chris, who has a wife and daughter, up until late June, he said. A 'significant amount' of the . businesswoman’s personal property has also gone missing, but DCI . McFarlane would not reveal what has disappeared. Her cash cards have been used in shopping . sprees at the Westfield centre in West London. Detectives believe a gang may have abducted Miss Waugh and made her divulge her PINs. Fraudster: Carole Waugh lived in an exclusive area of London and a fraudster is believed to have tried to sell her home . Officers from Scotland Yard last week . arrested four men and two women in connection with their inquiry and . yesterday charged unemployed Rakesh Bhayani with three counts of . conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. The charges relate to transactions associated with Ms Waugh’s identity worth in the region of £280,000, police said. Bhayani, 40, of Wembley, appeared via virtual court at Westminster Magistrates’ Court yesterday and was committed for trail to Southwark Crown Court for September 25. He remains in custody. The five other suspects have been bailed pending further investigations, the Met added. Ms Waugh, whose disappearance is . being investigated by the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, lives in . the exclusive Marylebone area of the capital. The . detective said Miss Waugh’s £650,000 flat in Marylebone was now being . examined in great detail by a forensic team and was likely to take . several days. The former civil servant, who made a . fortune working in Libya as a finance manager for oil companies during . the reign of Colonel Gaddafi, returned to London in 2008, apparently . looking for love. She was single and police are trying to trace men she may have met through internet dating sites. Detective Chief Inspector John . McFarlane, who is leading the investigation, said there has been no . confirmed contact with her for three months. He said: 'There have been a number of . sightings of her but I have not been able to confirm them at this . stage. The last time she had any contact with her family was on April . 17. 'Since Carole was last seen at least . three women have been involved in impersonating her at a number of . different venues. I also believe there are a number of men involved in . the fraud.' Yesterday it emerged that power cables to a CCTV camera pointing at her flat were cut in the lead-up to her disappearance. Neighbours have reported large numbers of people coming and going from her home following her disappearance. Yesterday her brother said: ‘She is a very confident businesswoman . who has done very well for herself. Miss Waugh's family say her disappearance is 'totally out of character' ‘She is very wealthy and she doesn’t need to work. Despite her being a very focused businesswoman, she was looking for Mr Right. ‘I think someone has targeted her as a . single woman in London with a nice property and money and we don’t know . if they have befriended her or just taken her.’ Just before she went . missing, Miss Waugh turned down a job offer in Malta and was planning a . 50th birthday trip to Las Vegas with a group of friends. Her brother and 78-year-old mother . Margaret, who both live in Durham, last saw her at Easter when she told . them about the American trip scheduled for June. ‘She seemed fine. She . was really looking forward to it,’ added Mr Waugh. ‘She was not worried about turning 50. She was looking forward to all the fuss and attention. ‘She phoned her mother every other day and suddenly the calls just stopped. My mother is absolutely beside herself. ‘We are very concerned about her. My mother is rather ill and it has had a real impact on her health.’ Forensic experts are now examining . Miss Waugh’s two-bedroom flat near Marble Arch in central London for . signs of a break-in or struggle. Police say she was last seen shopping in the capital on May 4. Her hobbies included going to the . opera, ballet and jogging and she was often seen sporting a £4,000 . Cartier gold bracelet and a man’s Breitling watch worth a similar . amount. Detective Chief Inspector John . McFarlane, said: ‘Miss . Waugh is a successful businesswoman, originally from the Durham area. ‘She has worked in the Middle East and has maintained a home in central London for a number of years. ‘Her disappearance is very out of . character.

Bob Diamond was yesterday accused of lying to MPs about the unfolding scandal at Barclays – but will still walk away from the bank with a £2million golden goodbye and millions of pounds’ worth of shares. Labour MP John Mann said the 60-year-old American, who resigned last week, had ‘calculatedly and deliberately misled’ MPs over the Libor rate-fixing scandal that has engulfed his company. The attack came after an explosive select committee hearing yesterday, . in which a damning letter from the Financial Services Authority to . Barclays appeared to make a mockery of Mr Diamond’s claims that he had . enjoyed the watchdog’s confidence. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Intervention: Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King summoned Barclays bosses to an emergency meeting and told them that Bob Diamond had to go . Severance: Barclays chairman Marcus Agius told the Treasury Select Committee that Bob Diamond has agreed to waive bonus awards and long-term incentive shares worth a potential £20 million . The letter was sent by FSA chairman Lord Turner to Barclays chairman . Marcus Agius on April 10 this year, and concerns the discovery that . Barclays had unethically tried to manipulate the Libor interbank lending . rate. It noted an ‘unfavourable’ impact on the ‘degree of external trust in . Barclays’ approach’ and accuses the bank’s bosses of being ‘at the . aggressive end of interpretation of the relevant rules and regulations’ and trying to ‘spin its messages in an unhelpful fashion’. Tory MP David Ruffley asked Mr Agius, 65, yesterday whether he had . received such a ‘damning’ letter during his long career in the City. Under fire: Barclays has had billions wiped off its shares since it was rocked by the Libor-fixing allegations . Disillusioned: Police and security guards stand in front of a Barclays Bank branch last week where protesters stuck messages to a banner during a demonstration against former CEO Bob Diamond . Bob Diamond: Giving up his bonus . Senior Bank of England staff discussed buying bikes to get around the City as a strategy to cope with crisis, a former minister revealed yesterday. Lord Myners, who was Labour’s City minister from 2008 to 2010, recalled the plan, proposed before the financial crisis hit. Casting doubt on whether the Bank should be handed extra powers, the former member of its Court of Directors told peers of a meeting he attended in ‘2006 or 2007’. He said: ‘One of the governors [there] proposed that as a mechanism to cope with crisis, the Bank should buy ... bicycles. ‘This tells you a huge amount about where the Bank sits in terms of its understanding of the complexity of financial markets.’ He raised the issue in the committee stage of the Financial Services Bill. The Government’s regulation shake-up will see  the Bank take over many responsibilities previously held by the Financial Services Authority. Mr Agius said: ‘I have not had another letter similar to this.’ But last week, Mr Diamond told MPs that the FSA was ‘specifically . pleased’ with him and some of his fellow executives. When asked if the . FSA had said it no longer had confidence in his senior management team, . he replied: ‘No, sir.’ Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, told Mr . Agius yesterday: ‘We did not feel that we got much clarity or openness . from Mr Diamond’s testimony’. Wednesday June 27: The banking industry is engulfed in a fresh scandal after Barclays pays £290 million to settle claims that it used underhand tactics to try to rig financial markets. Bob Diamond, who was in charge of Barclays Capital at the time the breaches occurred between 2005 and 2009, apologises and says he and three other key executives would waive their bonuses for this year.Thursday June 28: Serious Fraud Office investigators are in talks with the FSA over the scandal while pressure is mounting on Mr Diamond to stand down.Saturday June 30: An urgent independent review into the inter-bank lending rate is to be set up by the Government in the wake of the interest rigging scandal. The review will consider the future operation of the Libor rate and the possibility of introducing criminal sanctions, a Treasury source says.Mr Diamond is summoned to appear before the Treasury Select Committee on the following Wednesday.Sunday July 1: Barclays Bank chairman Marcus Agius is reported to be on the brink of stepping down. The development comes as Business Secretary Vince Cable backs calls for a criminal investigation into bankers involved in the affair. Tuesday July 3: Mr Diamond announces he is stepping down with immediate effect. Tuesday July 10: Mr Diamond gives up £20m in bonuses and shares but takes away around £2 million in salary and pension payments. Afterwards, Mr Mann said: ‘Mr Diamond’s evidence [last Wednesday] is not . worth the transcript it was written on. We now know he misled . Parliament. He should be recalled.’ But Mr Diamond last night hit back in a letter to Mr Tyrie, saying: ‘I . was dismayed that you and some of your fellow committee members appear . to have suggested that I was less than candid. ‘Any such suggestion would be totally unfair and unfounded.’ It also emerged yesterday that Mr Diamond’s resignation was triggered by Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King. Mr Agius, who also resigned last week, told MPs how he was ordered to . the Bank for an emergency meeting at 6pm on Monday last week, in which . Sir Mervyn made it clear that Mr Diamond had to leave. The conversation was ‘not capable of being misinterpreted’, Mr Agius . said. Following this conversation, Mr Agius visited Mr Diamond at home. Mr Tyrie said Sir Mervyn had handed ‘a loaded revolver’ to Mr Agius. Mr Diamond resigned at 7.30am the next day. Despite his humiliating departure, Mr Diamond, who has made around . £120million from Barclays over the past five years, will be paid his . ‘basic’ salary of £1.35million for the next year plus a lump sum cash . pension contribution of £675,000. Yesterday he promised to give up any rights to bonuses or share awards . worth up to £20million which he had expected over the next few years. But he still has 13.2million Barclays shares, currently worth around . £22million. Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘£2million or £20million as a reward . for failure for Mr Diamond?

Accused rogue trader Kweku Adoboli sobbed in court today as he insisted he did not act fraudulently while working at UBS . Accused rogue trader Kweku Adoboli sobbed in court today as he insisted he did not act fraudulently while working at UBS. Adoboli, 32, is accused of gambling away £1.5billion of the Swiss bank's money and wiping £3bn off its share price while working at its London headquarters. Prosecutors claim the trader ignored financial controls, including trading limits, and invented phantom transactions to disguise his 'naked gambling' from bosses in order to boost his ego and career prospects. It is alleged he was 'intimately aware' of how UBS's trading controls worked after moving from the back office to trading floor and was able to play the system a result. But Adoboli hit back at allegations he took advantage of his knowledge of the bank's inner workings today, saying he just wanted to 'do my job to the best of my ability'. He said: 'It was the ability to understand the interaction of systems and accounting processes that allows you to do your job. 'It is not fraudulent; it is finding a way to do your job.' He told the court he did not believe his 'rare skillset' had made it 'easier' for him to exploit the bank. 'The reality is systems and processes evolve, number one. 'Number two, the reality is every single trader, and salesperson, trade support advisor, and settlement person has a duty to understand the system, the tools that we use. 'So I do not think it is fair to say that my experience in settlement and trade support enabled me to more easily do something that has been characterised as fraud. 'Those experiences enabled me to do my job to the best of my ability.' In an at times emotional start to his evidence Adoboli wept twice when asked about his father, who sat in the public gallery, and his 'mentor' at UBS Mike Foster, the former head of the ETF desk. Mr Justice Keith told him he should not be embarrassed as it gave the jury a chance to 'see the man behind the name'. Adiboli described UBS as his family, adding: 'Every single bit of effort I put in to that organisation was for the benefit of the bank, the people around me, and the book I worked on. The bank for which was so proud to work. He told the court he had begun to trade off the book in a bid to generate enough profit to offset annual $40m losses being made by the ETF desk. He said that for three years from 2008 to 2010 the desk had lost £24m, and that in the first six months of 2011, before his arrest, it had lost £12m. The trader said the losses had come about from balance sheet costs, client execution costs, dividend slippage, and being unable to hedge certain equities. Adoboli said his life had become overcome by his efforts to make the ETF desk profitable. He told the jury he had missed his grandmother's funeral because of the work he was putting in to his job. 'Every moment of every day spent thinking about \"How do I make this book work?\". 'Nothing else was important enough to overcome that.' He said that through his constant market-watching he had begun to develop a 'gut instinct' for how it would move. Adoboli told the court that when he spoke to John Hughes, his 'supervisor and go-to person' he was 'not really interested' in off-setting the losses. 'He said: 'You begin to have to consider if I was committing a fraud because I was doing it for my own benefit, ultimately, my intent in every trade I was doing was to generate profits which would offset the costs which we could not find a way to hedge. 'In the process of doing so I began to learn more and more about how the market worked. 'I was growing more confident in my ability to call the market, to understand what might happen next in the market. 'As a result of that extra confidence by the end of 2009 I had made £3.5m profit for the book. 'My end goal was to generate £24m of profit that I could then release in to the book to offset the costs that I thought the book would incur in the period of a year.' Adoboli, 32, is accused of gambling away £1.5billion of UBS's money and wiping £3bn off its share price while working at its London headquarters . Adoboli went on to deny the prosecution suggestion that he was a 'gambler'. He . said: 'It's not \"I will just do a gamble on the market because that's . fun\" and the outcome I will hide away in a cash trade, absolutely not. Actually the cash trade is the end goal.' He . said the 'Umbrella', which prosecutors have suggested was a secret . 'slush fund', was nothing more than an 'accounting mechanism' to help . the ETF desk offset its losses, adding that his colleagues Hughes, Simon . Taylor, and Christophe Bertrand, were all aware of its existence. Adoboli . went on to describe Mr Foster, who left UBS before the period in which . Adoboli is alleged to have begun his fraudulent activities, as having a . 'lot of strong relationships' and being 'good at managing' both him and . his desk colleague John Hughes. After Foster left, Hughes took over as 'supervisor' of the ETF desk, said Adoboli, leaving two young men in charge of a '$50bn book'. Hughes, who gave evidence earlier in the trial, was described by Adoboli as 'quite maverick' and 'gung-ho'. He said: 'He did not really care about the book as a whole. He cared about being profitable as a trader.' Adoboli worked in the back office at UBS from September 2003 until December 2005 when he was employed as a trader. In September 2006 he was moved to the global synthetic equities division on the exchange traded funds (ETF) desk buying and selling ETFs, which track different types of stocks, bonds or commodities such as metals. At the start of today's hearing two additional charges of false accounting were added to the indictment. Mr Justice Keith, outlining what he described as the 'sensible reasons' for adding the charges, told the jury: 'It's been decided to add two additional counts to the indictment. 'Those additional counts do not add to the allegations which have already been made against Mr Adoboli. 'They have been inserted to clarify the allegations which are being made.' Adoboli, from east London, denies two counts of fraud by abuse of position and four counts of false accounting. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.\n",

A man has been given a record sentence for poaching rhinoceros horns in an elaborate fraud involving ‘fake hunts’ with Thai prostitutes in South Africa. Thai national Chumlong Lemtongthai was sentenced to 40 years in jail by for shipping large quantities of rhino horns to Asia for ‘selfish financial gain’. Mr Chumlong, 44, paid the prostitutes $800 go to game farms and pose next to rhinos killed by others to provide proof the horns were souvenirs. Jailed: Thai national Chumlong Lemtongthai has been handed a record 40-year jail sentence for an elaborate fraud to ship poached rhinoceros horns to Asia . It is legal for foreigners to hunt rhinos in South Africa and ship horns overseas as long as it is for personal trophies. Judge Prince Manyathi said Chumlong fraudulently obtained hunting permits to kill 26 rhinos and then shipped most of the horns to Asia to sell for a profit. ‘The shooting was not for trophy hunting. It was for horn trading,’ Manyathi said, adding rhinos were a symbol of the country and continent. ‘We cannot allow anybody to take our pride away.’ South Africa is home to almost all of Africa's rhinos and has been in an escalating arms race with poachers who smuggle horns to China, Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere. Its value there as a medicine is about $65,000 a kilogram, making it more expensive than gold. Faking it: Chumlong Lemtongthai paid Thair prostitutes $800 to take part in 'fake hunts' and pose next to dead rhinos to make it look like the horns were souvenirs . Chumlong did not make any statement when he was handed his sentence but his lawyers said they planned an appeal. Chumlong pleaded guilty on Wednesday to more than 50 counts of illegal exports and violating environmental protection laws. The environment ministry said the . sentence was the longest ever handed out for rhino poaching. It was also . harsher than the minimum term for murder. Between October 2010 and May 2011, . more than two dozen rhinos were killed on licensed 'hunts' arranged by . Chumlong. The horns were mounted as trophies and sent  to the owner of a . wildlife trading firm called Xaysavang Trading Export-Import in Laos . Illegal sales: The horns were mounted on trophies and shipped to Laos where they were allegedly sold on to south-east Asia where it is believed to be a cancer cure . In 2011, Chumlong signed a deal with the South African owner of a hunting reserve requesting horns from an additional 50 rhinos, with a street value of about $20 million, according to documents obtained by Reuters. Increased demand meant poaching has hit record levels in South Africa where, by mid-October, 455 rhinos had been killed illegally. There were 448 in 2011. Poaching increased dramatically from about 2007 as a growing affluent class in east and southeast Asia began spending more on rhino horn where it is believed by many to prevent and cure cancer. According to some studies, rhino poaching has reached a level that is causing species decline.\n",

Guilty: The 76-year-old media mogul wasn't in the courtroom for the verdict on the case stemming from dealings in his Mediaset business empire . Former Italian prime minister Silvio . Berlusconi was yesterday sentenced to four years in jail for tax fraud – . only for his sentence to be immediately cut. The 76-year-old’s prison term was . swiftly reduced to one year because of a 2006 amnesty law aimed at . reducing prison overcrowding. However, legal experts said last . night that, because of his age and Italy’s lengthy appeals process, it . is unlikely that he will spend any time behind bars. Berlusconi and four others, . convicted for their part in what judge Edoardo D’Avossa described as a . ‘significant tax evasion’, were also fined ten million euros. In addition, the billionaire media tycoon was banned from public office for five years. The 76-year-old billionaire businessman, who was among 11 defendants on trial, is expected to remain free until the appeals process is exhausted. In Italy, cases must pass two levels of appeal before the verdicts are final. The conviction was the media mogul's . first in a career seemingly dogged by criminal probes and trials that have all ended in acquittal or were . thrown out after time ran out to prosecute. Just last week, he appeared in the same courthouse for another trial in which he is accused of paying for sex with an under-age teenager and then trying to cover it up. Scroll down for a timeline of Berlusconi's previous brushes with the law. Sentenced: Judge Edoardo D'Avossa reads out the sentence today in a decision that capped a trial in which Berlusconi was accused of masterminding a scheme to illegally inflate the price paid for television rights . But today, the media mogul wasn't in . the courtroom for the verdict, which comes two days after he announced he will not run in Italy's upcoming elections. Instead, his lawyers denounced the verdict in a statement as 'absolutely incredible'. Prosecutors allege the defendants were . behind a scheme to purchase the rights to broadcast U.S. movies on . Berlusconi's private television networks through a series of offshore . companies and had falsely declared the payments to avoid taxes. Prosecutors further alleged the . inflated the price for the TV rights of some 3,000 films as they . relicensed them internally to Berlusconi's networks, pocketing the . difference amounting to around €250million (£200million). Out on the town: Silvio Berlusconi seen shopping in the center of Milan on the same day he was convicted . Happier days: Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, center, is photographed with two unidentified women in 2004. Today's verdict came a week after he appeared in court for another trial in which he is accused of paying for sex with an under-age teenager and trying to cover it up . Ladies' man? Berlusconi looks on next to Italy's . swimmer world champion Federica Pellegrini  in 2009, left, and poses . for a picture with a supporter in 2010, right . Other . charges of false accounting and false statements in financial reports . were thrown out because the statute of limitations expired. The three-time premier stepped down . last November after Italy came under mounting market pressure to deal . with its high debt load and Berlusconi failed to come up with persuasive . financial reforms. Berlusconi's . designated political heir as the head of the center-right party he . leads, Angelino Alfano, blasted the verdict Friday as 'incomprehensible' and said he was confident an appeals court would throw out the . conviction. Berlusconi is not the first former Italian premier to be convicted of criminal charges. Former Socialist Premier Bettino . Craxi (pictured) eluded an arrest warrant and turned up at his villa in Tunisia in . 1994 after a court in Italy charged him in a massive corruption case. He was tried in absentia, convicted . and sentenced to 8 1/2 years in prison, never returned to Italy and died . in exile. Craxi was considered Berlusconi's mentor thanks to his . opening to private television in Italy from a state monopoly. Former . seven-time Christian Democrat premier, Giulio Andreotti, was convicted . of involvement in a Mafia-murder. But he was cleared on appeal and never . went to jail . In this . and other cases against him, Berlusconi has described himself as the . innocent victim of prosecutors he contends sympathize with the left. Indeed, in 2009, he described himself as ‘the most persecuted person in the entire history of the world’. Up . until now, other criminal investigation probes against him on charges . including corruption had ended in acquittal or were thrown out for . statute of limitations. Of . the other defendants, three were acquitted, including a close associate . of Berlusconi, Fedele Confalonieri, chairman of Mediaset. Berlusconi . and three others were convicted, including a Hollywood producer, Frank . Agrama, who received a three-year sentence. Berlusconi, . along with other defendants convicted in the case, must deposit a total . of €10 million (£8million) into a court-ordered fund as appeals, which . could take years, proceed. The . trial began in July 2006, but was put on hold by a now-defunct immunity . law that shielded the Berlusconi from prosecution while he was premier . until it was watered down by the constitutional court. The trial also . faced delays as Berlusconi cited conflicts with his schedule as premier. Berlusconi has been tried numerous times for his business dealings. He has always denied wrongdoing and alleged that the cases were politically motivated. In each case to date, he has been cleared or seen the statute of limitations expire. The . statute of limitations in this case is set to expire sometime next . year. In Italy, cases must pass two levels of appeal before the verdicts . are final. Berlusconi also is on trial in Milan on charges of paying for sex with an under-age teenager and trying to cover it up. Troubles ahead: The conviction was the media mogul's first in a career seemingly dogged by criminal probes and trials that have all ended in acquittal or were thrown out after time ran out to prosecute . Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76, is accused in another trial of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug in 2010 when she was 17 . Appearing in court last Friday, he said he believed the then 17-year-old . dancer, Karima ‘Ruby the Heartstealer’ El Mahroug, was really 24 when . he was alleged to have paid her for sex in 2010. Mr . Berlusconi told the court that ‘nothing vulgar or scandalous’ had ever . occurred during parties at his villa in Acore, and that the now . notorious phrase ‘bunga bunga’ stemmed from a joke someone had made. He said prosecution claims that the . evenings were orgies in which he paid prostitutes dressed as nuns to . perform strip shows had been made up to discredit him. He . also denied having had sex with Miss El Mahroug, who is Moroccan, or . any of the guests at his parties, adding: 'Everything happened in front . of staff and, at times, my children came in to say \"hello\"'. But . several guests have already testified how strippers performed and money . was exchanged for sex. Mr Berlusconi also insisted he was innocent of . abuse of office. Prosecutors . say he lied to the police in May 2010, telling them Miss El Mahroug was . the granddaughter of the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in order . to have her released after she was held for suspected theft. Denials: Ms El-Mahroug who is widely known as Ruby Rubacuori ('heart-stealer') has always denied having sex with the prime minister when she was 17 - or being a prostitute . The list of witnesses named by Berlusconi are a roll call of the rich and famous and are said to have been guests at one of Mr Berlusconi's parties. They include Real Madrid footballer Cristiano . Ronaldo, Hollywood star George Clooney and his girlfriend, and the . Italian model and TV star Elisabetta Canalis. Who me? Berlusconi's career has been dogged by scandal and criminal probe .

A conman who lived on benefits posed as a billionaire businessman to seduce a Harvard-educated Sotheby’s executive into handing him more than £600,000. Cambridge University drop-out Alistair Stewart, 53, convinced Nina Siegenthaler he was a former Goldman Sachs partner now running his own hedge fund in Switzerland and the owner of a private jet, a yacht and a helicopter. He targeted her by pretending to be interested in buying a £9million property on the Caribbean tax haven of Turks and  Caicos where Miss Siegenthaler is vice-president of Sotheby’s International Realty. Conman: Alistair Stewart, left, seduced Nina Siegenthaler, a wealthy woman out of more than £600,000 by posing as a retired Goldman Sachs billionaire . After catching her at a low point in her life, he spent six months grooming her on Skype, during which time she fell in love with him and agreed to let him invest her life savings. He blew almost all of the cash in only four months by taking trips to see her, buying a £50,000 Mercedes, stays at luxury hotels and helicopter trips to London to shop at Harrods. Stewart, who now faces jail, also cheated at least five other victims including a New York interior designer by pretending to be a super-rich international businessman after researching the role on the internet. In fact, he operated his sophisticated con on his own from a computer in his housing association bedsit in Burgess Hill, West Sussex, where he survived for most of the time on benefits. Miss Siegenthaler yesterday said the experience had been ‘absolutely horrendous’ after Stewart appeared at the Old Bailey to admit fraud. The art history graduate, who has completed an executive programme on real estate management at Harvard Business School, said she did not wish to comment fully until next month’s sentencing, but urged others to be alert to the risks of conmen working on the internet. She added: ‘You never believe something like this could happen to you. It is absolutely surreal. It is vital people realise the dangers that are out there. I hope this acts as a warning.’ Prosecutor Ben Maguire said outside court: ‘This man is a sophisticated conman. Victim: Nina Siegenthaler was a real estate agent living in the Turks and Caicos Islands, pictured . ‘He managed to persuade this poor lady he was a billionaire financier with Goldman Sachs who had started his own fund. ‘He groomed her over about six months. She fell in love with him and sent him one million dollars. He then funded a lifestyle that was like that of a billionaire.’ Detective Sergeant Mick Richards, of the Economic Crime Unit at Sussex Police, said: ‘Most people would wonder “how was it possible to con people so successfully?” ‘Only when you meet him do you realise what he is capable  of. His attention to detail was remarkable. ‘He was meticulous in researching every aspect of his scam on the internet, from complex financial systems to types of aircraft used by the very rich so that he could successfully present himself as an international fund manager. ‘Miss Siegenthaler has been incredibly strong through what has been a long investigation and we are very relieved to finally have a successful result for her.’ Stewart received the money from Miss Siegenthaler on September 27, 2010, but had spent almost all of it by January 2011. Only £40,000 has been recovered. The Old Bailey, pictured, where Stewart pleaded guilty to one count of fraud on a 'full facts basis' Stewart also convinced a US interior designer he could offer her work worth more than £500,000 over three years. And he told a husband and wife that he was a former Goldman Sachs partner and could employ them as a captain and cook on his yacht. At the Old Bailey yesterday he admitted one count of fraud on a ‘full facts basis’ which encompasses 12 allegations. Stewart has been staying at The Priory, the private mental health hospital best known for treating celebrities. Mr Maguire said: ‘We are not aware how he can afford the costs of the Priory.’Judge Stephen Kramer QC remanded Stewart in custody  for sentencing on December 19.

A name-dropping carpenter charmed a solicitor's wife out of thousands of pounds during their affair by claiming he lived next door to Johnny Depp and went on shooting jaunts with Eric Clapton. Victor Knight was a penniless . carpenter but posed as a businessman from a wealthy family who was about . to inherit a £17 million fortune. He wrecked the marriage of solicitor’s wife Jane Hadley-Piggin, who fell for his string of lies about his wealth and background and took out a £25,000 loan to invest in his business. False friends: Victor Knight had an affair with Jane Hadley-Piggin telling her he lived next door to actor Johnny Depp, left, and went shooting with guitar legend Eric Clapton, right . Knight claimed to go shooting with Eric Clapton and to have a mansion next to Johnny Depp’s multimillion-pound home in the West Country. He told 49-year-old Mrs Hadley-Piggin his mother owned a large estate in Gloucestershire and villas in the Algarve and Florida where she spent the winter months, but it was all lies. Mrs Hadley-Piggin’s marriage broke up after she started an affair with the smooth-talking conman who even fooled her parents and promised a lavish wedding before the money dried up and his lies were exposed. In reality he was a bungling cabinet maker from Bampton in North Devon who was also ripping off customers who hired him to do building work, Exeter Crown Court was told. He took on a major project to build a . new studio office for a business near Honiton but left owners Hugo and . Michaela Montgomery-Swan with huge bills after bungling the scheme and . lying about having the materials in stock. When police arrested him they found an instruction manual entitled How to Build a Barn in his van. Knight, . 61, who was based at Kersdown Barn, Bampton, Devon, but is now of . Chipstable, near Taunton, Somerset, admitted four offences of fraud and . was jailed for 32 weeks by Judge Erik Salomonsen. He . told him: 'When you began your relationship with Mrs Hadley-Piggin you . told lie after lie after lie and the consequence of that is the charge . which you have admitted, but it was the tip of the iceberg. 'She took out a loan which she could not afford and according to your basis of plea you enjoyed the benefit of £10,000 of that. All lies: He told 49-year-old Ms Hadley-Piggin's his mother owned a large estate in Gloucestershire and villas in Florida and on Portugal's Algarve coast, pictured, where she spent the winter months . 'This was not a single fraud. Your . offending involved false representations to Mrs Hadley Piggin and the . Mrs Montgomery-Swan. Only a custodial sentence is justified given the . nature and extent of your offending.' Mr . Joss Ticehurst, prosecuting, said the offences all date back to 2008 to . 2009 when Knight told lies during his personal relationship with Mrs Hadley-Piggin and his business dealings with the Montgomery-Swans. He met Mrs Hadley-Piggin when he worked at her home and started an affair with her at a time when her marriage was under stress. He . said: 'She succumbed to his charms. He described himself as a man from a . privileged background. He said his mother was exceedingly wealthy with . properties around the world and a large estate in Gloucestershire. 'He . said he had a £10,000 a month allowance and was ultimately worth more . than £10 million and she fell for it. These claims were a refrain which . he used on other people including the Montgomery-Swans. Justice: Knight, 61, admitted four counts of fraud and was jailed for 32 weeks by Judge Erik Salomonsen at Exeter Crown Court . 'Jane fell under his spell and they became romantically involved and was generous towards him, giving access to her credit cards, thinking he would repay them.' Mr Ticehurst said he got her to take out a £25,000 loan by telling her he needed the money to complete a barn conversion in Sherborne St John, Hampshire, which he would sell for £350,000 and thus enable them to marry and set up home together. She has ended repaying £27,272 and although he says he only received £10,000 the rest went to repay other debts he ran up while he was with her. He said he swindled publisher Hugo Montgomery-Swan and his wife Michaela by getting them to pay money up front for £10,000 worth of oak he claimed to have in stock but which did not exist. The couple were building a barn-style office at their home at Dulford, near Honiton, and he claimed to be able to handle the project but police found an instruction manual in his car. Mr Rupert Taylor, defending, said Knight now accepts he has done wrong and has a complete change of heart since the offences happened. He said: 'He told lies about his financial background while he was falling in love with someone and he became completely out of his depth. 'He did not pre plan this as a confidence trick. He is someone who gradually became embroiled and got into difficulties.' After the case Mrs Hadley-Piggin, who lived Uplowman at the time but has since moved to Witheridge, said: 'I am delighted with the result. It is a relief and brings some closure. He may be called Knight but he is no knight in shining armour. 'The past three years have been a living nightmare which has had a terrible effect on me, my marriage and our children. 'It has cost me four times as much as the £10,000 they mentioned in court. I was left with debts on phone contracts and credit card bills. 'He told so many lies. He said he went shooting with Eric Clapton and had a house next to Johnny Depp and was worth £17 million. I am glad he has faced justice at last.' Michaela Montgomery-Swan said Knight had contributed to the failure of part of their business last year and they are still paying to repair the sub standard work he did. She said: 'I hope this will act as a warning to others. You see so much about dodgy builders these days it is good that they suffer the consequences when they are caught.' Detective Constable Perriam said: 'I am pleased with the result of this case and I would be interested to hear from anyone else who may have had dealings with Knight.'\n",

The UK's most revered technology entrepreneur, known as 'Britain's Bill Gates', has denied masterminding a £3billion accounting cover-up as a bitter row with his former bosses at Hewlett Packard intensified today. Dr Mike Lynch made more than £500million by selling his home-grown software firm Autonomy last year in a £7.1billion deal but now the American company has wiped £5.5billion ($8.8bn) off its value. HP boss Meg Whitman blames ‘accounting improprieties’ by 'certain former Autonomy employees' for the £3billion loss, accusing Lynch and others of 'lying' to them by inflating revenues and profit margins for at least two years before the deal was struck. But Dr Lynch denies the claims and says that the 300 auditors HP had poring over their books would have picked up any problems. Tonight he ruled out legal action against those making the claims and pointed the finger at HP. Row: British technology guru Dr Mike Lynch (left) denies his company orchestrated a £3bn accounting cover-up when he sold his Autonomy company to Meg Whitman's (right) Hewlett Packard last year . Appearing on Sky News, he told Jeff Randall: 'HP was once a great company. If that business can get back to its core and fix itself then I think Autonomy will have a good future. HP needs to stop trying to deflect attention away from itself.' After the write-off, HP's shares dropped to $11 yesterday - down 12 per cent - the lowest level for HP in a decade. Dr Lynch, 47, who is a non-executive director of the BBC and adviser to David Cameron, could now face a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and today said he was furious about the claims levelled at him and rejected them all. He lives in a £6millon Grade II-listed Georgian manor house in Suffolk, with eight bedrooms and five bathrooms, and sits in 70 acres of grounds with private woodland, paddocks, a swimming pool, four cottages and a lodge.

Grand: The mansion has 70 acres of grounds with private woodland, paddocks, a swimming pool, four cottages and a lodge. 'The figures are just mad. Things would have to have gone pretty badly wrong to justify writing $8.8bn,' Dr Lynch said in his rebuttal. 'It . is utterly untrue. We reject this as utterly untrue. Everything we did . we gave correctly to the auditors and was correctly noted by the . auditors. 'I don't . understand how you can write-down this amount and say somehow this was . all caused by something you didn't notice when you did due diligence . with 300 people. It would have been kind of a big elephant to miss.' According to HP, evidence of an accounting cover-up was . apparently revealed to them by a former Autonomy executive whistleblower within the last . six months. It has already been passed to financial prosecutors on both . sides of the Atlantic. Lynch has 'flatly rejected' the accusations and said he was 'shocked' but confident he would be absolved of any misdeeds . He left HP after Autonomy missed budget forecasts and says that Autonomy has been mismanaged since his exit. Tech giant: Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto in California, has taken a £5.5billion hit after accusing staff at Autonomy - a British company it purchased last year - of cooking the books to increase its company value . Dr Lynch is on the BBC's executive board and said today that it had spoken to him and would not ask him to resign as a non executive director. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The BBC has spoken to Dr Mike Lynch regarding the allegations made against his company in the media.  We note that the company has denied the allegations. 'We have not asked Dr Lynch to step down from his role as a BBC Non-Executive Director. We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will take any further action should it become necessary.' HP also said it would also . ‘aggressively pursue’ individual Autonomy executives to recoup financial . damages for its shareholders. The allegations come six months after . Dr Lynch walked away from the business he founded after he fell out with . management, insiders say. New Yorker Meg Whitman is arguably . America's most successful businesswoman with a CV littered with jobs . at some of the world's biggest companies. The . mother-of-two is the fourth wealthiest woman in California with a net . worth of $1.3billion, mainly built up while serving as eBay’s chief executive . from 1998 to 2008. In that . time she started with 30 employees and boosted it to 15,000 staff . within a decade, drawing in an incredible $8bn in annual revenues. Previously . she had worked at giants like Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Procter & . Gamble and Hasbro before joining Hewlett Packard on an annual salary of . $1 - but also around $16million of stock options and other perks . including a company plane. She . also attempted a political career and in 2010 shattered the record for . the biggest spending candidate in any U.S. election in history. She . splashed out a staggering $119 million of her own money in her failed . bid to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as California’s next Republican . governor. By shelling out . another $15 million from her hi-tech fortune , she surpassed the $109 . million spent by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg on his 2009 . re-election campaign. Her track-record in business is hallmarked with her reputation for her determination in driving companies to success. When he started a . software company in his garage in 1996, Mike Lynch could not have dreamt . he would one day sell it for more than £7billion. Those who knew . him well say that Lynch is intelligent driven, and ambitious, and . predicted the sale of Autonomy, which netted him just over half a . billion pounds, would not be the last that we would hear of Dr Lynch. Little . were they to know that he would reappear as he did yesterday, with the . allegations levelled by Hewlett Packard throwing him back into the . spotlight. After he was born in County Tipperary in Ireland in . 1965 to a fireman and a nurse, Lynch’s family moved to Chelmsford, Essex . while he was still a child. There Mike showed early signs of his fierce intelligence, and won a scholarship to the nearby private school Bancroft’s. He . went on to study physics, maths and biochemistry at Christ’s College, . Cambridge, before opting to spend the next years of his life in . academia. It was the miracle growth of Autonomy that earned him the title ‘Britain’s Bill Gates’. He was given an OBE in 1996 and a year later was appointed to the BBC executive committee as a non-executive director. He . lives in a Grade II listed Georgian manor house in Suffolk, although it . is not known whether he has a family at the massive home.The £6m estate has 70 acres of grounds and is surrounded by private woodland. Autonomy rose from humble beginnings . in 1996 to become a darling of the City and a member of the FTSE 100 . index of the UK’s biggest companies. It was seen as a great success story . of British innovation, providing computer programs that processed large . amounts of data to thousands of small businesses. Software giant Oracle says it had the chance to buy Autonomy but decided it was incredibly over-priced, its founder Larry Ellison has said. The world's sixth richest man said Mike Lynch approached him with a deal but he balked at the proposed $6bn value. 'We looked at the price and thought it was absurdly high,' he said a month after HP did the deal. It then turned into a war of words between him and Dr Lynch, who said: 'If some bank happened to come with us on a list, that is nothing to do with us.” But Oracle then declared it was 'another whopper from Autonomy CEO Mike Lynch.' The statement went on: 'Either Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying. 'Some bank did not just happen to come to Oracle with Autonomy \"on a list.\" The truth is that Mr. Lynch came to Oracle, along with his investment banker.' To further embarrass Lynch, Oracle then released a slides detailing Autonomy’s financial health they had received. Ten years after founding the firm, . Irish-born and Cambridge-educated Dr Lynch was awarded an OBE. HP’s chief executive Meg Whitman, was not in charge when it bought Autonomy. Former HP boss Leo Apotheker led the acquisition of Autonomy and in his two years in charge the company's share valuedropped by 45 per cent, with a big dip when they completed the deal. She issued a strongly worded . statement about the affair. She alleged that ‘some former members . of Autonomy’s management team used accounting improprieties, . misrepresentations and disclosure failures to inflate the underlying . financial metrics of the company, prior to Autonomy’s acquisition by . HP’. She added: ‘These efforts appear to . have been a wilful effort to mislead investors and potential buyers, and . severely impacted HP management’s ability to fairly value Autonomy at . the time of the deal.’ Miss Whitman has passed details of the . financial cover-ups to the UK’s Serious Fraud Office and its US . equivalent, the Securities and Exchanges Commission, ‘for civil and . criminal investigation’. Although she refused to name the . executives who were likely to be questioned, she said ‘a senior member . of Autonomy’s leadership team came forward [with the details] following . the departure of Mike Lynch’. It is thought to be unlikely that any financial cover-up would occur without the knowledge of Dr Lynch. A PR company acting for Dr Lynch . yesterday issued a statement saying he was ‘shocked to see this . statement today, and flatly rejects these allegations, which are false’. It added: ‘HP’s senior management has also been closely involved with running Autonomy for the past year. ‘It took ten years to build Autonomy’s . industry-leading technology and it is sad to see how it has been . mismanaged since its acquisition by HP.’ The SFO refused to comment on whether it would launch an investigation.

      "101. By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:44 EST, 6 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:51 EST, 6 December 2012 . Two men have become the first in Britain to be jailed for land banking fraud today after conning elderly and vulnerable people out of £3million. Omar Eshpari, 33, and Stefan Mitchell, 42, masterminded the deception, conning people into buying plots of land that were either worthless or massively over-priced. A string of fraudulent companies were set up and sold land bought cheaply across England or plots they did not even own. First in Britain: Omar Eshpari (left) and Stefan Mitchell (right) were jailed for seven and six years respectively for masterminding a £3million deception in a 'landmark moment' for police in the fight to prevent fraud . The locations were marketed as being in a prime position for development and would quickly increase in value. In reality, investors were putting their money into plots located on farmland, in the Green Belt, within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or on the sides of hills, with no chance of gaining planning permission let alone building houses. Some received small returns while others lost everything, with the duo funnelling off the funds into a network of bank accounts. Over a two-year period, more than 300 victims fell foul of the gang. Among the victims was an elderly man who was suffering from terminal cancer losing almost £300,000 and a retired woman who was conned out of £373,000. Eshpari, from Enfield, north London, and Mitchell, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, used virtual offices with London addresses and professionally-produced brochures and websites to legitimise their operation. Cold-calling and high-pressure sale tactics were put into play to target and then bully people into buying into their scheme. By late 2009, more and more investors were becoming concerned about the lack of returns from Pemberton International, Eldon International, Willow International, Allied Investment and Abacus Investment, and were increasingly asking for their money back. No profit: Prosecutor Luke Dockwray told Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) that 'only a miracle would produce a development opportunity, let alone a profit' from the land the men claimed to be selling . But following reports from numerous . victims and a detailed City of London Police investigation, working . closely with agencies including Companies Investigation Branch and the . Financial Services Authority, a series of arrests were made in October . 2009. Eshpari and Mitchell were jailed for seven and six years respectively at London's Isleworth Crown Court today. Commander Steve Head said: ‘The UK's first land banking fraud convictions is a landmark moment for all those committed to combating and preventing fraud, and sends out a clear message to the criminal community that law enforcement is wise to their new tricks and is taking decisive action.’ Detective constable David Parkinson, from the City of London Police, said: ‘Eshpari and Mitchell preyed on the vulnerable, exploiting their desire to put their savings in something tangible that would provide them with long-term security. ‘They cared not from whom they stole, but only for what they could take. High-pressure sale tactics: The men targeted and bullied people into buying into the scheme, convincing people into buying plots of farmland (stock picture) that were either worthless or massively over-priced . ‘Plots of land that were good for nothing and worth a fraction of the asking price were marketed as a sound investment with planning permissions in the pipeline and development round the corner. ‘The gang used all the tricks of the trade to give the appearance of legitimacy, picked off their targets over the phone and then disappeared without trace with their savings. ‘A complex and painstaking investigation by the City of London Police has ensured Eshpari and Mitchell have now been made to pay for the deception they created and the damage they caused.’ Luke Dockwray, prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service central fraud division, said: ‘Far from being ripe for development, one site in Halifax was on a 40-degree slope with Tree Preservation Orders and a Japanese Knotweed problem. ‘All the land consisted of undivided plots in fields; only a miracle would produce a development opportunity, let alone a profit.’ Land banking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with fraudsters swapping shares in a company for plots of land as a way to entice people into making an investment. Victims are led to believe the land is ripe for development and can only go up in value. The reality is that it is worth a fraction of what it is being marketed at, or even nothing at all, and the people they have trusted with their savings are, in fact, highly-skilled criminals.\n",
      "102. By . Jill Reilly and Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 15:13 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 10 December 2012 . Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian Prime Minister, has confirmed that he will stand in next year’s election, a year after being forced to resign amid a sex scandal and a debt crisis. The flamboyant 76-year-old media tycoon, who faces possible jail time for tax fraud and a trial for having sex with an underage prostitute, declared he would not allow Italy to spiral into recession and said he had been 'besieged by requests' to run. Berlusconi had hinted for months that he might make a comeback in the election which is due in about three months’ time. Is running for office: Italy's disgraced former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has confirmed that he will run for leadership again in next year's election . Berlusconi's centre-right People of Liberty Party (PDL) lags Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) by at least 16 percentage points in opinion polls, and also trails the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. While another Berlusconi victory looks almost impossible, the man who has dominated Italy's centre-right for 19 years may hope to help it win enough support to keep the centre-left from winning a clear majority in both houses of parliament. The question mark that remains over the election is whether the current prime minister will run. So far current Prime Minister Mario Monti has said he will step in only if the election result is unclear, but there has been speculation he could join forces with a centrist group. But his criticism of Monti's handling of the economy was particularly harsh and came at a critical moment in the run-up to the parliamentary polls. 'The situation today is much worse than . it was a year ago when I left the government out of a sense of . responsibility and a love for my country,' Berlusconi said in a . statement issued after a long meeting with his People of Liberty (PDL) party leaders earlier in the day. Loyal: Supporters of fromer Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi hold a banner reading 'Silvio, Italy believes in you' in front of Berlusconi's Roman residence on Thursday . 'I cannot let my country fall into a recessive spiral without end. It's not possible to go on like this,' Berlusconi said after explaining that he had been 'besieged by requests from (his) party to announce at the soonest my re-entry into politics to guide the PDL.' Berlusconi's comeback arrives slightly more than a year after he resigned as prime minister as collapsing market confidence pushed Italy's debt costs to critical levels. His international reputation had already been left in tatters by lurid stories of ‘bunga bunga’ parties with pole-dancing prostitutes at his home outside Milan. He is currently appealing a four-year jail sentence for tax fraud and faces a trial over paying for sex with an underage nightclub dancer. Italians will probably vote in March with a recession that began mid-way through last year showing no signs of abating and unemployment at 11.1 percent, a record high. ‘I race to win,’ Berlusconi told reporters at the practice field for AC Milan, the soccer club he controls, after repeating criticism of Monti's handling of the economy over the past year. Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76, is accused in another trial of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug in 2010 when she was 17 . He said: ‘To win, everyone said there had to be a tested leader. It's not that we did not look for one. We did, and how! But there isn't one... I'm doing it out of a sense of responsibility.’ His move may unsettle financial markets, whose loss of faith in Berlusconi's guidance of the economy pushed the country to the edge of a Greek-style debt crisis last year and prompted President Giorgio Napolitano to ask the former European commissioner Monti to step in to restore confidence. With the support of a right-left coalition including the PDL, Monti imposed austerity measures to bring borrowing costs under control, but Berlusconi said on Wednesday that the economic professor's policies had left Italy facing a ‘recessive spiral without end’. The PDL withdrew parliamentary . support for Monti on Thursday, raising the spectre of a snap election . and driving up the difference between German and Italian benchmark bonds . by about 30 basis points. President . Giorgio Napolitano asked the former European commissioner Monti to form . a government of technocrats with the support of a right-left coalition . that includes the PDL. Monti . imposed austerity measures to bring borrowing costs under control. But . the higher taxes have weighed on consumer spending and deepened a . recession that began in the second half of last year. Criticised: Berlusconi has argued that current Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's handling of the economy has been particularly harsh . Though the euro zone's third-biggest economy is still struggling, Monti has calmed the financial markets and the spread between Italy and German benchmark bonds this week fell to nearly half the level it was when he took over. Monti, who is a life-appointed Senator, says he will not stand in next year's vote, but is willing to step in afterward if the result is not clear. The tone of Berlusconi's statement echoed comments made and broadcast on his Mediaset television network when he entered politics in 1994, saying he would 'take the field' to save the country from communism. In recent months, Berlusconi's hesitation to say whether or not he would run in parliamentary elections has left the centre-right in disarray just as its centre-left rivals picked their candidate, Democratic Party (PD) leader Pier Luigi Bersani, in a primary vote on Sunday. Bersani met Monti for the first time as a candidate earlier on Wednesday, and the prime minister praised the primary vote, ANSA news agency reported citing government sources. Troubled: October's conviction was the media mogul's first in a career seemingly dogged by criminal probes and trials that have all ended in acquittal or were thrown out after time ran out to prosecute . Who me? Berlusconi's career has been dogged by scandal and criminal probe . October 2012: .

A crooked financial controller was jailed for two years today for stealing £90,000 from the property tycoon husband of former Neighbours star Holly Valance. Ross Smith, 26, altered invoices to syphon cash from Candy & Candy, run by brothers Christian and Nick Candy, into three bank accounts in his name over a two-and-a-half-year period. Nick Candy, 39, married former Neighbours star Holly Valance, 29, at a lavish wedding in Beverley Hills earlier this year. Theft: Financial controller Ross Smith was jailed for two years today for stealing from developer Nick Candy - who married actress Holly Valance this year . Smith's fraud was discovered after bosses uncovered a string of suspicious payments on company credit cards and launched an investigation. The Work in Progress Controller plundered client accounts linked to the £20m interior design of 15 apartments at One Hyde Park, where properties sell for up to £65m. Southwark Crown Court heard Smith, who earned £25,000 a year, blew the stolen cash on funding his lifestyle and settling debts. He later claimed it had been 'easy' to steal from the property magnates due to their 'lax' financial controls. Exclusive: Smith plundered the decorating budget of One Hyde Park - Candy & Candy's top development . Stunning: This Penthouse apartment at One Hyde Park is the most expensive property in Britain costing £136million . Fraud: Smith said stealing from the Candy brothers (Nick and Holly left and Christian and wife Emily right) was easy because they had 'lax' financial controls . Jailing Smith judge David Higgins said: 'In essence you stopped to sustained criminal wrongdoing to fund a lifestyle you could not otherwise afford and you did so in breach of the highest degree of trust. 'Your behaviour was routinely deplorable and deeply antisocial and if you choose to behave in this way then you must, of course, accept the consequences. 'I do accept that this is a sad case though I have to add how you could seriously have any legal or financial ambition with your attitude is far from clear. 'You did indeed show some promise which you have of course thrown away because of your moral turpitude.' Smith pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position between July 1, 2009, and January 25, 2012 earlier this year. Jailed: Smith was sent to prison for two years at Southwark Crown Court for his £90,000 fraud . Prosecutor Usha Shergill said Smith's dishonesty was uncovered after he left his job at Candy & Candy in March 2012. She said Smith had been responsible for a number of client accounts which had 'substantial funds advanced to Candy & Candy' to pay for fixtures, fittings and equipment. He also had access to company credit cards, used by employees to entertain clients. The barrister said that after Smith left the firm's finance discovered around £1,100 of unauthorised expenditure on company credit cards team during a routine check. When confronted Smith claimed initially it was just £525 but later admitted to spending £948. He paid the firm £1,600 and wrote to Nick Candy saying 'I'm sorry for that, I was stupid'. A further investigation uncovered the true extent of Smith's stealing. Ms Shergill said: 'From April 2009 to January 2012 they identified a total of 26 credits to the RBA accounts in the name of the defendant. 'The credits totalled £91,849. 'It appears a total of £26,294 was credited back to Candy & Candy client accounts from Mr Smith's RBS accounts. 'What is outstanding is the sum of £65,555.' In interview Smith told detectives: 'I got in to financial difficulties for several reasons and I then realised how easy it was and how lax their financial controls were and I found it easy to do what I did'. For Smith, defence counsel Roger Sahota said his client had begun stealing to settle a £4,000 rent debt to prevent himself and his flatmates from being evicted. He said: 'Basically this is a tragic case, he is 26 now and was 23 when he began at Candy & Candy. 'He's a young man with some academic promise and he's basically thrown his future away'. Mr Sahota said Smith had not told his mother about his conviction because he was 'so ashamed he could not bear to break the news to her' and had not told his current employers.

Arrogant and reckless, bankers at UBS nicknamed one another the ‘three muscateers’, ‘superman’ and ‘Captain Caos’ as they rigged a crucial City interest rate. And yesterday their corruption cost their City of London employer a fine of nearly £1billion. Watchdogs said rigging the Libor interest rate – used to calculate the mortgages of millions – was ‘routine, widespread and condoned by a number of managers’ at UBS. UBS has been fined nearly £1bn for the Libor-rigging scandal which included a record £160m fine from the FSA . The regulators also said the behaviour . of some staff was ‘even more serious’ than what happened at Barclays – . fined £290million earlier this year for rigging Libor. A string of compromising emails reveal . the UBS bankers’ congratulatory nicknames, though it appeared that, . despite their huge salaries, they were as reckless with their spelling . as they were with the bank’s cash. An Italian judge has found four international banks guilty of fraud in a case involving the sale of derivatives to the city of Milan and ordered the confiscation of €88 million. Judge Oscar Magi on Wednesday convicted Deutsche Bank, UBS, JP Morgan and Depfa Bank, as well as nine current and former bankers. In Italy, institutions may be held responsible as well individuals. The individuals received suspended sentences of six months to eight months. The banks have denied wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege that the city of Milan lost €105million as part of the sale of bonds totaling €1.69billion between 2005 and 2007. Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo said the verdict recognized the importance of 'the fundamental principal of transparency on the part of banks in contracts with public administrations.' A 40-page report from the Financial . Services Authority condemns staff at UBS for Libor rigging between . January 2005 and December 2010. The regulator fined UBS £160million, with the remainder of the total fine split between Swiss and US regulators. The FSA said that staff fixed Libor . rates to benefit their own trading activities. They also rigged Libor . during the financial crisis to make the bank appear stronger than it . was. They set up fictitious and ‘corrupt’ transactions to pay each other for Libor-rigging and, said the FSA, . awareness of such wrongdoing went as high as managerial level. The City watchdog said their . activities ‘undermined the integrity’ of the benchmark rate, which is . used to calculate financial transactions worth more than £300trillion, . including mortgage rates. Extracts from messages exchanged between UBS staff reveal their astonishing arrogance. In one, ‘Trader A’ asks a broker at . another firm to help him set a high rate, addressing his friend as . ‘superman’ and urging him to ‘be a hero today’. A broker at another bank accepted the . challenge of rigging Libor with glee, telling Trader A he was ‘putting . the captain caos outfit on as we speak’. Trader A was named as one of . ‘three muscateers’. Such was the regularity of . manipulation that one banker, in response to a single request to fix . Libor, replied ‘Standing order, sir?’ The FSA said misconduct at UBS was 'extensive and widespread' with traders routinely trying to benefit their trading positions . Sergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS, said the group had 'taken decisive and appropriate actions' following the probe . The FSA said the UBS case was . ‘considerably more serious than Barclays’ because the wrongdoing was . more widespread and senior managers were aware of it. It raised . particular concern over one exchange, in which a UBS trader offered to . pay a broker friend if he will leave the rate unchanged. The trader wrote: ‘I’ll pay you, you know, 50,000 dollars, 100,000 dollars ...whatever you want. I’m a man of my word.’ Such rewards were arranged through . so-called ‘wash trades’, risk-free trades that cancelled each other out . but generated ‘illicit fees’ of more than £170,000 for brokers. The traders quoted in the FSA’s report . have not been named, but two UBS staff – 33-year-old Briton Tom Hayes . and Roger Darin, 41, based in Switzerland – were yesterday charged in . the US with conspiracy to fix Libor. They face the prospect of . extradition. The FSA said the behaviour at UBS showed a ‘total disregard for proper standards’. Some 40 staff were involved in making . more than 1,000 ‘improper requests’, while a further 70 would have been . aware of the wrongdoing. UBS chief Sergio Ermotti said: ‘We deeply regret this inappropriate and unethical behaviour.’ The revelations are another blow to . the Swiss bank’s deals reputation, after trader Kweku Adoboli was found . guilty of fraud earlier this year after his bad deals lost £1.4billion. The Financial Services Bill, which . received Royal Assent yesterday creates a criminal offence for making . ‘misleading statements’ in relation to benchmark rates such as Libor. Andrew Tyrie MP, who is leading the . Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said the FSA report had . exposed ‘collusion, corruption and much else besides.’\n",

Conrad De Souza has been ordered to pay back £270,000 of the money he earned while pretending to be a qualified doctor for Lewisham . Primary Care Trust (PCT) between 2001 and 2010. He was jailed for 27 months in October last year. De Souza, 54, of Whitmore Road, in Beckenham, received more than £329,000 from the NHS in fraudulently obtained earnings, Croydon Crown Court heard on December 5. At the PCT, he was employed in highly-paid strategic roles for which it was essential to have a degree and clinical specialisms — however, he had neither. De Souza, pictured left, was asked to supply the DNA sample after medical researcher Silke Luetzelschwab, right with her daughter, became pregnant following an affair . NHS Protect anti-fraud specialist David Horsley said: 'As a result of his deception, Mr De Souza has not only served a substantial prison sentence for his crimes but has also been ordered to pay £270,000. 'The confiscation order of £270,000 should serve as a warning to anyone tempted to defraud the NHS that, wherever appropriate, NHS Protect will not only seek criminal, civil and disciplinary sanctions but will press for the recovery of any lost NHS funds.' De Souza's deception was discovered when he was caught faking a DNA sample to avoid maintenance costs for a child he had with a one-time lover. He pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation at Croydon Crown Court. At the trial, prosecutor Robert O’Sullivan said De Souza had lied about having three years’ experience at a busy practice in Beckenham. The court heard his CV 'could be . described as a work of fiction' and that he had used details of another . doctor with a similar name to get the jobs. The . Tanzanian-born British citizen had enrolled at the University of London . medical school in 1980 but never graduated. Sangita Modgil, mitigating, . said De Souza had come from a successful family and could not cope with . having failed university. Croydon Crown Court heard that De Souza, 54, had received more than £329,000 from the NHS in fraudulently obtained earnings . She said describing himself as a doctor was something of huge importance to his self-esteem. At the time a spokesman from NHS Lewisham said De Souza had never treated patients, examined them or prescribed medication to them while in his roles as clinical advisor at NHS Lewisham and as assistant clinical director for the South East London Cardiac and Stroke Network. Judge Simon Pratt described his behaviour as 'brazen' and said he had been 'deeply dishonest and wilfully manipulative.' He said: 'You were an articulate, driven and deeply dishonest man without any apparent conscience about what you were doing.' In a separate case heard at Bromley Magistrates’ Court, De Souza had pleaded guilty to a charge of fraud by false representation after falsifying a DNA sample. He was asked to supply the sample after medical researcher Silke Luetzelschwab became pregnant following an affair. De Souza refused to acknowledge fathering the child and Miss Luetzelschwab was forced to contact the Child Support Agency. The court heard he supplied the DNA of a close male relative, most likely his father’s. De Souza was later proved to be the father of Miss Luetzelschwab’s daughter, who was born in December 2009, after which the investigation began. It was also revealed that he was in fact married. Speaking after sentencing, Stuart Richards, the principle legal enforcement manager for the Child Support Agency in the south east, said De Souza had been 'living a lie'. He said: 'This was perhaps the most sophisticated attempt to cheat a mother and child out of financial support that the CSA has ever seen.'

A middle-class mother of three stole more than £30,000 from her bosses to fund chronic eating binges. Susan Foxcroft, 47, spent more than £100 each day gorging on sandwiches, sweets and drinks. She told a court she had suffered from severe bulimia and anorexia for 16 years and that she had become trapped in a spiral of bingeing and purging. Jailed: Mother of three Susan Foxcroft said she had diverted cash from her company because she did not want her husband to find out about her eating disorder . Foxcroft claimed she took the money to keep the disorder hidden from her husband. She was able to transfer large sums into her bank account because she worked as a book-keeper at the firm. Yesterday she was branded ‘thoroughly . dishonest’ by a judge who sentenced her to three and a half years in . jail. Judge Patrick Field QC said that, although she had admitted two . counts of fraud, she had shown no remorse. He added: ‘I have plenty of . sympathy for you and for your eating disorder but it constitutes no . excuse whatsoever for what you have done.’ Foxcroft, whose children are grown-up, . lived with her husband, Jonathan, 49, in a smart £240,000 detached home . in Rossendale, Lancashire. Fraud: Foxcroft forged letters from her boss at Welding Engineers (Mersey) Ltd to cover up her crimes . She oversaw the finances at Welding Engineers in Manchester, which makes and installs industrial doors. Manchester Crown Court heard she began . using bank transfers and company cheques to siphon off money. Between . 2009 and 2011 she took a total of £31,302, leaving the firm with dire . financial problems. John Richards, defending, said: ‘She’s been suffering from severe bulimia and anorexia for 16 years. Further damage: Foxcroft sent Mr Austin threatening texts and falsely claimed that the firm had been dodging taxes, sparking an investigation into the company . ‘She has confidence and self-image . problems, and most importantly, as regards the commission of this . offence, she tells me she was spending upwards of £100 a day on food.’ Foxcroft, was exposed only when . bankruptcy proceedings against her led to an investigation of her . finances. When the Insolvency Service questioned her about large . deposits into her accounts she claimed that the cash payments were . ‘bonuses.’  In a bid to support the lie she forged a series of  letters . from managing director Stephen Austin which corroborated the claim. She . also sent a series of threatening text messages to Mr Austin and . intercepted his mail in a desperate attempt to cover her tracks. Mr Austin found out about the extent . of the fraud after a letter from the Insolvency Service eventually found . its way through to him. When Foxcroft was caught out, she falsely . claimed the firm had been dodging taxes, triggering an investigation . into the company. The court heard staff pay at Welding . Engineers had been frozen because of the loss of money. The firm also . spent around four months of man hours investigating the fraud and its . impact. The court also heard Foxcroft had already been spared jail for stealing £6,000 from a previous employer. After being sacked, Foxcroft worked for a time as a TV extra.\n",

British citizens who marry foreigners will have to earn at least £20,000 a year if they want to set up their family home in the UK under a new immigration clampdown. The planned changes mean lower-paid Britons would be forced to emigrate if they wanted to live with a loved one from overseas. And if the foreign-born spouse had children, their British partner would have to earn £30,000 or more, depending on how many children they had. Clampdown: British citizens who marry foreigners will have to earn at least £20,000 a year if they want to set up their family home in the UK. Home Secretary Theresa May is pictured talking about the new policy on The Andrew Marr Show today . They will also have to pass a strict new 'combined attachment test' to prove they share a genuine loyalty to Britain, not another country, and they will remain on probation for five years instead of the current two. The proposals, to be announced by Home Secretary Theresa May, are expected to cut immigration, currently standing at 250,000 a year, by 25,000. They are designed primarily to combat claims that some foreigners are marrying Britons to take advantage of the UK's generous welfare system. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show today, Mrs May said: 'I think it is important that if . people are bringing people into the UK to create a family here in the UK . that we say that you should be able to support yourselves and not be . reliant on the state.' Tory MPs last night welcomed the move but Labour spokesman Chris Bryant said: 'These new measures have more to do with Theresa May's abject failure to live up to her promise to cut immigration than fairness.' He claimed the idea was 'poorly thought out', adding: 'It seems very unfair that a poor British man or woman can fall in love with someone from America or Thailand and be prevented from getting married and making a home here, while a rich person can.' Labour MP Chris Bryant called the plans 'poorly thought-out' He said a better way to deal with the . problem would be to insist that Britons who marry foreigners and settle . here provide a bond worth 'a substantial sum'. If the immigrant went on . to claim benefits, the money would be deducted from the bond. And immigration campaigners are expected to denounce the measures, claiming the new curbs would effectively give low-earning Britons who fall in love with foreigners the choice of indefinite 'exile' – or  breaking up their family if they want to stay in the UK. The Home Secretary also issued a . warning to judges today  that their powers to block the deportation of foreign . criminals on human rights grounds must be curbed. Mrs May said she would be seeking the . backing of Parliament for new guidelines for the courts spelling out . how the courts should apply the European Convention on Human Rights in . such cases. In particular, she said she would be . making clear that the right to a family life enshrined in Article 8 of . the convention - used by some foreign criminals to appeal against . removal from the country - was not absolute. She complained the judges were not taking account of the wider public interest in the way the convention enabled them to. And she warned that if they ignored the will of Parliament, she would bring in new legislation to ensure that it was enforced. 'This is not an absolute right. So in . the interests of the economy or of controlling migration or of public . order - those sort of issues - the state has a right to qualify this . right to a family life,' she said. 'What I am going to do is actually . set out the rules that say this is what Parliament, this is what the . public believe is how you balance the public interest against the . individual's interest. 'We are going to ask Parliament to vote on this to say very clearly what constitutes the right to a family life. 'I would expect that judges will look . at what Parliament will say and that they will take into account what . Parliament has said. If they don't then we will have to look at other . measures and that could include primary legislation.' Firm: The Home Secretary also issued a warning to judges today that their powers to block the deportation of foreign criminals on human rights grounds must be curbed . Mrs May said that the Home Office was . also looking at contingency arrangements in case the the eurozone . crisis triggered a flood of immigrants into Britain. 'So far we are not seeing any trends . in any increased movements, despite obviously significant problems . already economically in a number of eurozone countries,' she said. 'But I think that it is right that, as . a Government, across the board we look at the contingency arrangements . that might be needed.' Behind bars: In April, Rev Brian Shipsides, pictured, was jailed for helping to carry out nearly 250 sham marriages in which he pocketed £30,000 in proceeds . A senior Government source said last night: 'The welfare system has abused for years under Labour by people who marry Britons and within a short period are living off benefits. 'There is little we can do to stop them claiming benefits but we can implement better controls on people who come here to marry in the first place. We are confident these moves will command widespread support from the public. 'Labour's lamentable record on immigration is one of the main reasons they lost the election. We are going to put the system right.' Ms May said earlier this year that it was obvious that British citizens and those settled here should be able to marry or enter into a civil partnership with whomever they choose. But she added: 'If they want to establish their family life in the UK, rather than overseas, then their spouse or partner must have a genuine attachment to the UK, be able to speak English, and integrate into our society, and they must not be a burden on the taxpayer. 'Families should be able to manage their own lives. If a British citizen or a person settled here cannot support their foreign spouse or partner they cannot expect the taxpayer to do it for them.' The Joint Council for the Welfare of . Immigrants says an extension of the probationary period for foreign . spouses could trap more women in violent marriages because of the fear . of being deported if they complain. Mr . Bryant added: 'At a time when our national finances are hard-stretched . it is only fair that anyone wanting to bring someone new to this country . should be able to prove that they will not be a burden on the State. 'But I worry that the Government will not achieve what it hopes with this . measure, and that they have rejected options that could provide better . protection for the taxpayer and be fairer too. 'In today's climate, someone on £20,000 today could all too easily be earning nothing tomorrow. 'So simply relying on income as a measure may lead to the taxpayer still being exposed.' In April, a vicar was jailed for helping to carry out nearly 250 sham marriages in which he pocketed £30,000 in proceeds. Jailed: The Rev Brian Shipsides, 56, was jailed for four and a half years for arranging bogus ceremonies for African nationals to marry European citizens so they could stay in Britain.

Former British Army officer Robert Jolleys arrives at Swindon Crown Court, where he is accused of expenses fraud . A senior officer fraudulently claimed nearly £220,000 from the Army to send his children to a top public school, it was alleged in court yesterday. Former Lieutenant Colonel Robert Jolleys is said to have pretended he was still with his wife Judith after the couple had split up in order to claim the ‘eye-watering’ amount of cash. The change in circumstances meant he would no longer have been entitled to claim from the Army’s education fund. His three sons Rupert, now 22, Charles, 20 and William, 15, were being sent to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire. One of the most prestigious Catholic boarding schools in Britain, it charges fees of £28,000 a year. Despite no longer qualifying for the benefit when he ceased to be main financial provider after the break-up in 2002, Jolleys claimed the benefit for seven further years, a jury was told. It was only a chance phone call by his wife to the Army that uncovered the fact Jolleys was no longer married. He is also alleged to have ‘bullied’ his former partner to help him maintain the pretence. Swindon Crown Court was told how Jolleys – a ‘highly intelligent and clever man’– would not have been able to fund his sons through the school without the swindled money. The jury heard how Jolleys carried out the fraud while working for the Directorate of Education Training Services for the Army in Swindon. Prosecutor Nicolas Gerasimidis said Jolleys did not inform the MoD of the change of circumstances to claim cash from the Army’s Continuous Educational Allowance, which pays 90 per cent of fees in certain circumstances. It was in 2009 the deception was uncovered by accident. Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘Judith phoned his base to find out where he was and she told officers she was no longer married to Jolleys. ‘This was a surprise to his superiors.’ The court heard that following the separation Jolleys, continued to live in quarters specifically for serving members of the Forces who were married. The jury heard how Jolleys tried to ‘bully’ his wife into supporting the claim. Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘He bullied her and provided her with a document which told her what to say.’ Records also showed Jolleys attempted to file a retrospective application in an attempt to change his status to reveal he was separated. But this was rejected by Army personnel. Jolleys, of Whalley, Lancashire, denies 11 counts of deception and fraud between 2002 and 2009. The alleged bogus claims totalling £218,094.11 were made at bases where Jolleys was serving in Upavon, Oxfordshire, and Harrogate, Yorkshire. The trial continues.

The lover of a serial con artist who posed as a playboy Italian aristocrat has admitted how she helped him by collecting cash from one of his victims. Gail Heyworth, 51, lived a life of luxury thanks to the lies of Scott Travis despite claiming she was also one of his victims. However, she was found to be the person collecting cash from one of his victims when another woman came forward after being duped out of nearly £12,000 by Travis. Travis is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for blackmail and fraud. However, his latest conviction revealed that he conned a Muslim woman looking for a religious marriage after meeting her on a dating website. Con artists: Scott Travis, left, and Gail Heyworth, right, plotted to fool a Muslim woman looking for love into handing over almost £12,000 in cash .

The 45-year-old fraudster, who lived . with Heyworth in a council flat in Heywood, Rochdale, posed as a . 'well-heeled bachelor' on SingleMuslim.com called Mohammed Kashif Rai who was looking for a bride. He met a 25-year-old woman online and reeled her in with lies about extensive financial interests and property portfolio before concocting a sob story to ask for cash. His partner Gail Heyworth, 51, then met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money. Travis wooed the the woman via text and email - but made sure he never physically met her or his cover would be blown. The couple would travel to locations in Manchester such as the Trafford Centre and Cheetham Hill where Heyworth would accept wads of cash in an envelope on behalf of her man. Form: The court heard how conman Scott Travis has a history of fraudulent activity . Heyworth, of Baguley Crescent, Middleton, admitted fraud by false representation at Manchester Crown Court yesterday on the day her trial was due to begin. Travis is currently serving . eight years in jail for a separate fraud after posing as an Italian aristocrat to dupe an . 82-year-old man out of £100,000. He women and the . elderly out of cash by falsely claiming he was Viscount Franco Dibella . III and that he stood to inherit a £1.7m fortune. His charades had led to a huge . spending spree in which he acquired a £50,000 Lexus car, had cosmetic . surgery and he stayed for six weeks in a four star £200-a-night hotel and enjoyed weekends away in Monte Carlo . He also employed his own chauffeur, . drank bottles of £80 Bollinger champagne and splashed on suits and . shirts from designer boutiques and dined out at exclusive restaurants. Manchester Crown Court was told that when he was younger, Travis was told his mother was actually his sister because she was only 15 when he was born. He was brought up in a humble council house to a working class family in Rochdale. Formerly known as Paul Marsden he . changed his name by deed poll to Scott Travis and embarked on a series . of frauds by assuming up to four fake identities and made up tall tales . of how he used to play drums with rock band Whitesnake. He falsely alleged the US rock band owed him huge sums in royalties for songs he had written. He showed friends a big box of songs . he claimed to have written sold to the supergroup and sent his family . tickets whenever they played gigs - although he never appeared on stage.

Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Travis has a very long history of fraud and fraudulent behaviour.' 'Gail Heyworth, knowing his background . and knowing he had been arrested for fraud matters in January, then . became aware that he was contacting, through the ‘Single Muslim’ website, single young women looking for a religious match, and was posing as Mohammed Kashif Rai, who was very well-heeled and had a lot of financial interests and many properties. 'Gail Heyworth, knowing that, then travelled in a vehicle with Mr Travis in order to screen him from the lady in question because his appearance was not that which he described, adopting a ruse of being a family friend. 'She met the woman on two occasions and took envelopes of cash from her, knowing it was part of the fraud. It’s these two journeys that go essentially beyond mere knowledge.' In 2005 Travis was first exposed as a . liar and jailed for 16 months when he applied for a £7,500 loan and . secured it against Heyworth's flat - using her details and even imitated . a woman's voice when he spoke to brokers from the company.

A disgraced former magistrate has been spared jail after fraudulently claiming more than £22,000 in expenses over five years, a court heard today. Carlton Janson, 69, made the false claims while sitting as a JP at Bolton Magistrates’ Court. He made false claims for loss of earnings to the tune of £20,585 and exaggerated mileage claims which came to £1,419 between 2006 and 2011, Burnley Crown Court heard. Carlton Janson thanked the judge who gave him a suspended prison sentence, and has promised to pay the money back within two months . Kirsten McAteer, prosecuting, told the court that Janson began his career as a magistrate in April 2000 but that the fraud only came to light in 2011 when questions were raised about a 'financial loss allowance' claim he had made. Miss McAteer said checks are made on the claims of all magistrates but that 'there is a certain level of trust involved' in the system. JPs are not paid and are allowed to claim mileage and loss of earnings, the court heard. Janson claimed that the initial fraudulent claim was made in error but further investigations into his claims led to discrepancies being discovered as far back as 2006. He later told police he thought he could make the claims because he was working extra hours to make the time back. Bolton Magistrates court where Carlton Janson used to sit as a JP, but he was caught fraudulently claiming money . But his boss told investigators that Janson’s hours were flexible so no deductions had been made from his salary. Miss McAteer said Janson was claiming for loss of earnings even after he semi-retired in December 2008. Janson would also claim mileage of 19 miles for his trips to court even though his home was only two miles away. Andrew Nuttall, defending, said Janson was a man of good character who was remorseful, ashamed and embarrassed over what he had done and that he fully intended to pay the full sum back with the help of his family, who attended the hearing. Mr Nuttall said the offending began shortly after his only daughter died of cancer at the age of 34 in 2005. He said Janson was a 'decent, hardworking man' who never learned how to deal with the tragedy and lost his 'moral compass'. Mr Nuttall added: 'It cannot be a coincidence that these offences started just after he suffered a grievous loss in his family.' Janson, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to two offences of obtaining property by deception and two counts of fraud. Grey-haired Janson, wearing a navy . blue suit, walked into the dock with the use of a walking stick, and . said: 'Thank you, Your Honour' when Judge Andrew Woolman passed his . sentence of eight months in prison, suspended for two years. The retired buyer at Pharmatube in . Greater Manchester has pledged to pay back the full amount within two . months with the help of his family. Judge Andrew Woolman told the . defendant: 'You have brought shame and disgrace on yourself and your . family and it will take a lot of living down.' The judge said the shame and disgrace Janson had brought on himself was 'punishment in itself.' He added: 'You have, of course, . seriously let yourself, your family and the Bolton bench down. Magistrates are expected to behave properly and, of course, honestly.' But the judge said that Janson’s . actions 'did not take away' from the service he contributed to the bench . and said his poor health, which included 'mild Parkinson’s', depression . and arthritis, had been a mitigating factor. Judge Woolman told Janson the case would be brought back to court on May 20 if he failed to pay back the money. Janson thanked the judged and hugged his wife on his way out of court. The disgraced JP has sat on cases which have attracted media attention. Most notably he was chairman of the bench for the case of Jake Preston, a benefit cheat who claimed he could not walk but was secretly filmed throwing his motorbike around while racing to victory in a British motocross championship competition. Detective Constable Neil Tate, from Greater Manchester Police’s Volume Fraud Team, said: 'For more than 10 years Janson sat as a magistrate and performed an invaluable public service. 'Unfortunately we uncovered evidence that he was also stealing from the public purse since 2006. 'The cost to the taxpayer is considerable and his actions calculated and committed over a prolonged period of time. 'He perhaps thought that because he was in the privileged position of upholding the law he could break the rules or that they did not apply to him. 'They very much did and this case shows the police, CPS and courts will take positive action against those who break the law, regardless of their standing.'\n",

Jailed: Rohan Pershad QC was today jailed for three and a half years for failing to pay £600,000 in VAT . A high-flying barrister who specialises in fraud cases has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for failing to pay £600,000 in VAT. Rohan Pershad, 45, who had been working as a Queen’s Counsel, a member of the legal profession’s elite, at London’s 39 Essex Street Chambers, enjoyed a gold-plated pay package. But Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Pershad stopped paying tax in 1999. He was found guilty of cheating the public revenue to pocket the cash over a 12-year period after trying to claim that he was 'extremely poor at paperwork'. The court heard that most barristers are self-employed and legally required to pay their own VAT. Pershad, whose income rose from £85,000 in 2001 to £346,000 by 2008, was charging VAT on his fees but failed to pass a penny on to HM Revenue & Customs between June 1999 and September 2011. The money helped to buy a £1.1million home in Virginia Water, Surrey, and a £490,000 home in Somerset. In sentencing, Judge Aidan Marron QC told Pershad: 'You have brought disgrace on yourself and have aggravated that position by fighting this case and lying in front of a jury. 'It saddens me that I have to deal with you.' Describing Pershad as having been 'a person of substance to date', the judge added: 'It is sad that you, a successful and otherwise compassionate man, should have sunk to these particular levels.' Pershad, who specialised in financial disputes, professional negligence and insurance cases, had been guilty of a 'persistent' fraud, the judge said. Convicted: Pershad, a barrister, stopped paying his own VAT in 1999 - shortly before he moved to the Thirty Nine Essex Street chambers - and then fell off the tax register, meaning he 'disappeared off the VAT radar' Hearing: Pershad was found guilty of cheating the public revenue at London's Blackfriars Crown Court after the jury was asked to give a majority verdict following more than nine hours of deliberations . During his nine-day trial, jurors heard that most barristers were self-employed and were legally required to pay their own VAT. Pershad stopped doing so in 1999, shortly before he moved to the Thirty Nine Essex Street chambers. He then fell off the tax register, . meaning he 'disappeared off the VAT radar' and was classed as a 'missing . trader' but he continued to work, the court heard. The prosecution said he knew what his legal responsibilities were. Denial: Pershad denied the charge against him, claiming he believed Thirty Nine Essex Street paid his VAT . The judge said: 'It is clear to me and was clear . during the trial that you decided to capitalise on that situation and in . the ensuing 12 years you cheated the revenue of £600,000. 'You willingly and knowingly engaged in persistent and consistent dishonesty.' Pershad was called to the bar in 1991 and was made QC in 2011. . Pershad, a father of four children . aged from 13 to 21 years, is now a 'broken man' who has brought shame on . his family, according to Mukul Chawla QC defending. Before this case he had been considered 'a man of previous exemplary good character', Mr Chawla noted. He said: 'He will never live down the . very public humiliation caused by his actions to him but perhaps more . pertinently caused to his family. 'Mr Pershad is a broken man.

A sales assistant for WHSmith secretly recorded customers' credit card details using a camera hidden inside a carton of Ribena. Shazed Ali, 26, fooled shoppers at a busy train station branch into handing over their cards by pretending there was a problem with them. The law graduate would then hold the cards up to the pinhole camera he had concealed inside the drinks carton so it could record their details, Birmingham Crown Court heard. A WHSmith sales assistant secretly recorded customers' credit card details using a camera hidden inside a carton of Ribena . The court was told that he captured information from 20 unwitting customers at the Birmingham New Street branch before his scam was rumbled. Ali then used the stolen card details to buy low-value items which went unnoticed on his victims' bank statements. He even had one purchase - a £20 memory stick - delivered to a neighbour's house to avoid detection. But the fraudster was caught out when he tried to buy a laptop - causing the concerned cardholder to alert police. At a preliminary hearing a district . judge said Ali, from Saltley, West Midlands, had committed a 'horrific . breach of trust' and described his offences as 'sophisticated' with 'a . degree of pre-planning'. But he was spared jail on Tuesday after a judge heard that he had no previous convictions and his girlfriend was pregnant. Birmingham Crown Court was told that he captured . information from 20 unwitting customers at the Birmingham New Street . branch (right) before his scam was rumbled . Ali, who pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud, was slapped with a community order, 100 hours of paid work and ordered to pay £475 court costs. Financial Investigator DC Michael Irwin, said: 'His trick was to claim there was a problem with the card and ask to see it, once the shopper handed it over he'd slyly hold it next to the carton so the pin-head camera could record the card numbers. 'We know that he successfully bought a computer memory stick valued at £20 and had it delivered to a neighbours' address, he may well have made other low-value fraudulent thefts that card holders have simply not spotted on their statements. 'People are generally trusting, you can understand why no-one was suspicious anything underhand was going on as this man worked for a well-known high street store. 'Our advice is to always be very protective of your card details, it's advisable not to physically hand over your bank card when paying and certainly not to let it out of your sight.'\n",

A lonely Australian widow who travelled half way across the world to find love has been found dead in suspicious circumstances in a rented villa in South Africa. Family members had urged 67-year-old Jette Jacobs, from Wagin, West Australia, not to fly to Johannesburg to be with a Nigerian man she was having a relationship with on the internet. She had already sent at least £50,000 to her Nigerian on-line lover, calling himself Jesse Orowo Omokoh, after meeting him on a dating website four years ago. Lost lovers: Jette Jacobs, who had travelled to South Africa from her home in Wagin, 150 miles south east of Perth, had lost her husband in 2002 and her subsequent partner in 2009 . Two years ago Miss Jacobs travelled to South Africa to meet Omokoh and spent some time with him without incident. She vowed to return to Johannesburg to be with him again. But now on that second visit her body has been found in her rented South African villa – and her money, credit cards, jewellery, laptop computer and other personal items have vanished. As she planned her second trip, police in Western Australia sent Miss Jacobs a letter that she might be the victim of fraud – but the letter arrived at her home shortly after she had left Australia. ‘The circumstances of Miss Jacobs’ death are still being investigated, but there is evidence that it is suspicious,’ said Detective Senior Sergeant Dom Blackshaw of West Australia’s Major Fraud Squad. Online lover: Miss Jacobs had already sent at least £50,000 to her Nigerian on-line lover, calling himself Jesse Orowo Omokoh, after meeting him on a dating website four years ago . Miss Jacobs’ son, who did not want to be named, told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph that her family and friends had tried to talk her out of making her second trip to meet the Nigerian, but she could not be dissuaded. ‘Mum went over for a couple of months and did not return,’ he said. Urging others who ‘find love’ on the internet to be cautious, he added: ‘As you can see, one consequence of the internet scammers has taken her life.’ Miss Jacobs’ son said people who find what they think is love on the internet should not follow through with it. ‘Don’t go, because at the end of the day they are running a business or a scam or what they want to believe it is, to lure people to go to Africa…there’s a possibility it’s a one way ticket and no return. ‘If you do meet someone who is truly in love with you, money doesn’t buy it.’ Miss Jacobs, who had travelled to South Africa from her home in Wagin, 150 miles south east of Perth, had lost her husband in 2002 and her subsequent partner in 2009. She was looking forward to meeting Omokoh again, but she received a message from him saying he could not get a visa to join her immediately. Detective Blackshaw said there was evidence that Omokoh had arrived in Johannesburg two days before reporting her death and giving a statement to local police. West Australian police run a warning website about relationship fraud that urges people not to respond to out-of-the-blue social media messages from strangers requesting romance, such as a friend request on Facebook. Lured to her death? Miss Jacobs' family had urged her not to fly to Johannesburg (pictured) to be with Omokoh after meeting him on a dating website four years ago . Other warnings include: . Be wary of overseas-based singles, especially if they confess their love for you after a short amount of time or want to know about your financial status. Remember that just because someone shares personal photos does not mean the pictures are of them - scammers often steal other people’s photos. Alarm bells should ring if someone you do not know personally requests money, particularly by a wire transfer service…which could be going to an account set up with a stolen identity.\n",

The daughter-in-law of fugitive Eddie Maher has told how she handed him into U.S. authorities because she feared for her life after finding out his real identity. Maher - known as 'Fast Eddie' - was jailed for five years for the 1993 theft of a security van containing £1.2million at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday. The 57-year-old spent almost 20 years on the run in the U.S. before being arrested in February last year. Scroll down for video .

Today Jessica King  told ITV's Daybreak that she . was not motivated by the £100,000 reward offered by Securicor for the . capture of Maher and return of the money. Ms King said: 'I was in fear for my life and to be honest it was just the right thing to do. 'When Eddie found out I knew, he threatened my life so really it had to be done.' Asked whether the reward had played any part in her decision, she added: 'I didn't even know the reward was real.

Dumped: Maher's Securicor van was found, but minus more than £1million in dozens of bags of cash . Losing his tail: Maher drove the van to nearby Landguard Point in Felixstowe where he got into its secure area and loaded about 30 sacks of cash into this stolen getaway vehicle . Elaborate plan: Maher then used this Opel Ascona as a second getaway vehicle . Covering his tracks: The Opel getaway car was later found torched . Police are set to launch a legal battle to stop Eddie Maher receiving a pension pot worth £125,000, it emerged today. Maher, 57, who stole £1.2million from his Securicor van in January 1993 was thought to have been penniless when he was arrested in America last year after 19 years on the run. But police discovered that he had been due a pension from his 12 years as a London firefighter before being forced to retire in 1991 due to a training injury. Maher who was jailed for five years at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday initially received an index-linked pension of around £300 a month. But the payments were frozen when he disappeared after stealing £1,172,500 while a colleague was delivering cash to a Lloyds bank in Felixstowe, Suffolk. Maher who was known as Fast Eddie had no way of collecting his pension while on the run in the U.S. and the payments due to him were retained by the London Fire Brigade. His monthly pension increased to its current level of £686 due to inflation, swelling the payments due to him to around £125,000 after interest. Suffolk Police confirmed that specialist financial fraud officers had launched an investigation to see if the money could be seized under the Criminal Justice Act. During Tuesday's hearing, David Nathan . QC, mitigating, said: 'An extraordinary aspect of this case is Mr . Maher's daughter-in-law had originally been the partner of his son Lee's . best friend. 'Lee won a lot of money on the lottery and she left her partner to marry Lee. 'When the money ran out, she did a . little research on Google on the name Maher and found out he was wanted . for the theft back in 1993. 'She heard that there was a reward and she went to the federal authorities.' Maher, originally from South Woodham . Ferrers, Essex, was due to stand trial for theft after being deported . from the US but changed his plea to guilty. The court heard that he benefited from the theft outside Lloyds Bank, Felixstowe, to the tune of £200,000. Police and prosecutors are now . preparing to retrieve Maher's fire service pension pot - thought to be . about £125,000 - through court proceedings. Maher was declared bankrupt in the US and told the court that any money he received from the theft was now gone. However, it is understood he accrued a pension worth about £600 a month during his time with the London Fire Service. Legal teams will discuss this during a series of hearings scheduled to take place at Ipswich Crown Court.\n",

A gang of conmen who tricked investors into paying £35million for almost worthless plots of land in a 'grotesque, cynical and merciless' fraud have been jailed today for a total of more than 26 years. Christopher Demetriou, 30, Daniel Webster, 29, Stephen Allan, 30, and Steven Percival, 29, duped more than 400 clients into the swindle by promises of vast profits. Potential buyers were told the plots . of land were to be used for the Olympics and were enticed with glossy brochures . between 2005 and 2010. But the plots actually turned out to be low-value farm land, in the Green Belt or no had planning permission. Ruthless: Christopher Demetriou, pictured left, was described as a 'dominant figure' in the fraud and jailed for six years and four months. Stephen Allan, pictured right, was instrumental in helping to trick the wife of a cancer sufferer into investing in the fake scheme and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years . Worthless: A group of conmen duped more than 400 clients into investing in plots of land, including this one near Chapel Lane, Dover, pictured, by claiming they would be used for the 2012 Olympics . The ruthless crooks duped one woman, who husband was diagnosed with cancer, out of more than £600,000 in the 'land banking' scam. Other victims of the gang, who hid behind false names and front companies, lost their homes and suffered nervous breakdowns. Judge Martin Beddoe said: 'In short this was a grotesque, cynical and merciless fraud conducted by the greedy who could not have failed to have realised the very great damage they were doing. 'The investors were persuaded by a team of brokers trained in the black art of pressure selling to part with money which in some cases was all they had saved. 'Many, once sucked in to making investments from which they had no return, were then pressured to go on and invest more in the hope something might materialise, trusting the assurances of those they believed to be working in their interests, people who they often came to think of as friend.' He said the four men had treated investors as 'contemptible prey to be chewed up and contemptibly spat out', adding: 'Many, many people have been ruined or brought very close to ruin by this con'. Webster was described by Judge Beddoe as a 'callous and greedy' man who attempted to use his 'arrogance and ridiculous self-belief' to convince jurors he was innocent. He was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail, having pocketed around £260,000 form the fraud. Allan, who was jailed for seven- and-a-half years, was slammed for the 'fake care and concern' he employed to trick the wife of cancer sufferer David Wright. Percival, who netted around £207,000, was also jailed for six-and-a-half years. Judge Beddoe said: 'Like Daniel . Webster you thought your skills as a conman and the employment of . crocodile tears might work here before the jury, they did not.' Demetriou who earlier admitted conspiracy to defraud investors was described as a 'dominant figure' in the fraud. He was jailed for six years and four . months after the court heard he set up five companies to launder almost . £9million of the profits and personally netting around £2million. He used the pseudonym 'Chris . Anthony', Webster gave himself the surname 'Legend', and Allan called . himself George Hackett and even set up a front company Allan and Hackett . Ltd, named after himself and his alter-ego. Percival named himself after . Spiderman star Toby Maguire as he gave the aggressive sales pitch to . lure customers into the web of deceit. Daniel Webster, pictured left, was described as 'callous and greedy' and jailed for six-and-a-half years in prison while Steven Percival, pictured right, who netted around £200,000, was also jailed for six-and-a-half years . Deception: The conmen inflated the value of the land and convinced their victims to invest using high-pressure sales techniques . 'Investors were persuaded to buy the plots by various high-pressure sales techniques, typically by cold-calling,' said prosecutor Andrew Bird. 'They puffed up the value of the plots of land, and making representations that planning permission was being obtained or that a blue-chip purchaser is interesting in purchasing the land. 'Promises were made that the investor could sell the land back to the marketing company.' One plot in Birling Road, Leybourne, West Malling, Kent, which was bought from Kent County Council for £80,000, was divided into 220 mini plots valued at just £363.63 each. The con artists then set about selling each plot for £10,000 a piece, promising rich rewards to investors and drawing up a brochure showing a 'wholly unrealistic' housing project. The scam used front companies including Countrywide Land Holdings Ltd, Countrywide Land, Regional Land, and Plateau Development and Land Ltd, all of which were linked to the same office on the 29th floor of an office block in Canary Wharf. Cancer sufferer Mr Wright and his wife Sandra-May were among those sucked into the scheme, investing a total of £628,013 in Countrywide Land after being promised hefty profits in return for buying land. The retired couple from Shoreham-on-Sea, West Sussex, were first approached in March 2005 by Allan posing as George Hackett. They were persuaded to part with more than £220,000 for plots in Folkestone, Kent, Aylesbury, Berkswell, in Coventry, Hillesden in Milton Keynes, and Marple in Stockport. 'In short . this was a grotesque, cynical and merciless fraud conducted by the . greedy who could not have failed to have realised the very great damage . they were doing.' Judge Martin Beddoe . The couple had received titles for the land but seen no return by November 2007, but were urged to buy more land in Meopham, in Kent. 'They were expecting Countrywide to take steps to get planning permission and for an opportunity to sell at a profit when the land was snapped up by a developer', said Mr Bird. By March 2009, the Wrights were growing anxious but were met with excuses over the delay and encouraged to invest another £17,500 in the West Malling site. Percival, as Toby Maguire, then told the couple some of their land was being bought up by an American investor, but another £100,000 was needed to seal the deal. The conmen strung them along with claims they were 'privileged clients', asking for increasing sums of money to ensure their investment returned a profit, until eventually they refused to pay any more and were told the money could not be returned. 'Mrs Wright felt that they had to keep paying or that they would lose everything', said Mr Bird. 'They had been promised financial returns and got nothing. 'They had been strung along and persuaded to make more and more payments.' The scam eventually unravelled after probes by police, trading standards, and the Financial Services Authority, as well as 2010 exposes in the Mail on Sunday. Paperwork showed plots of land in Slough, Sevenoaks, Plymouth, Horsham, Ely, Ascot, and Dover, were used in the scam, all of which were either green belt land or had no planning permission. Raids of the trio's homes revealed a host of fake passports, paperwork under aliases, and details of their victims. Percival's home computer had been used to search on Google for 'Countrywide Land Holding Scam' as the net tightened on the gang. The mastermind is believed to be a man called James Maynard, who is on the run and is thought to have fled the country. Percival, of Brenchley Close, Chislehurst, Webster, of Southborough Road, and Allan, of Langham Place, both Bromley, Kent, were all found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Demetriou, of Cranbourne Gardens, Ilford, Essex, admitted the charge. False promises: The conmen convinced investors the land was needed as part of plans to build the Olympic Village and Stadium in London among other lies . Landbanking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Companies . divide land into smaller plots and sell it to investors on the basis . that once it is available for development it will soar in value. Fraudsters will use high-pressure sales tactics by cold-calling names and numbers from publicly-available shareholder lists. They can also use email, post, word of mouth or talk at a seminar or exhibition. In . fact, the land is often in areas of natural beauty, historical interest . or has little chance of being built on and the people behind these . companies are actually highly-skilled criminals. The Financial Services Authority estimates landbanking schemes have so far cost UK investors more than £200million. Although . not all landbanking schemes are a scam, it is often not made clear to . investors that there are restrictions on the development of the land or . that it is otherwise protected. They offer this advice on how to protect yourself: . - . Contact the local council where the land is located and asking them . whether the land might ever be released for development. Just because . the person promoting or operating the scheme says it is guaranteed the . land will be developed does not necessarily mean it will be. - . If you have already invested in a scheme and are concerned, stop . sending money to the firm and individuals involved. If you have given . them your bank account details, tell your bank immediately.- . Contact the FSA Consumer Helpline with as much information as you can . about your investment and the company involved, including their contact . details and ‘firm reference number’ (FRN).

The judge said drug-addict Edward Hanratty had 'failed lamentably' as a father after pleading guilty to child neglect. Hanratty also jailed for three years on separate charges of conning a 91-year-old man . A neglectful father who put his 'self-indulgent drugs lifestyle' ahead of his baby son, who died when a television fell on his head, has been jailed today. Judge Anthony Russell, QC, the Recorder of Preston, told drug addict Edward Hanratty he had 'failed lamentably' as a father. Hanratty, 41, was passed out on the kitchen floor when the baby's mother Natalie McMilian, 25, knocked over the five-stone television after she had drunk alcohol and taken drugs. Four-month-old Kian McMillan died from catastrophic head injuries. He had been laying on a changing mat at the family home in Burnley, Lancashire, when McMillan knocked over the television set as she tried to plug in a scart lead to watch a DVD. Sentencing Hanratty to 10 months in prison for child neglect, Judge Russell said: 'It was abundantly clear that you and your partner were in no fit state to look after your child that night. 'Over the short life of your child you gave priority to yourself and your self-indulgent drugs lifestyle and neglected the life of Kian. 'You must bear some responsibility for the death because you were the father of Kian. 'You failed lamentably. You should have protected Kian from his mother's neglect.' Hanratty was also sentenced to three years in prison today for conning a 91-year-old man from Bradford out of his life savings. In January, his former partner McMillan, from Leeds, was imprisoned for 15 months after she admitted neglect over the death of Kian in December 2011. She was cleared of manslaughter by a jury. Hanratty, from Bradford, also pleaded guilty to child neglect during the trial after giving his evidence which Judge Russell described as 'a very poor display in the witness box'. He failed to turn up for the sentencing in January at Preston Crown Court because he said he had no money for his train fare from Bradford. Hanratty was sentenced today for draining nearly £30,000 from his victim to feed his drug addiction, the court heard. He had befriended the pensioner 15 years earlier when he randomly knocked on his door and asked  for financial help. They became friends but as the years went by Hanratty became more persistent in asking for money. In 2007 he was jailed for 30 months for dishonesty offences in which he duped another elderly victim out of money. Mother Natalie McMillan was jailed in January after pleading guilty to child neglect. Her son Kian, right, died of catastrophic head injuries when she knocked over the five-stone TV . He used that conviction to trick the . 91-year-old out of more money as he lied that he needed to pay hefty . compensation sums and court costs to save him from more time in jail. Hanratty even drew up a fake solicitor's letter demanding money when his elderly victim became suspicious. He was finally caught when a family . friend of the victim recorded phone calls made by the defendant in which . he asked for money, and passed them on to the police. Last November Hanratty pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to two counts of fraud. Judge Russell told him: 'The fraud is a particularly mean offence involving the targeting of a vulnerable elderly man who you had known for some years and had taken pity on you and given you money over a long period of time. 'Preying on the elderly in this way is utterly reprehensible.' Hanratty received a two-month concurrent sentence for stealing a boy's pedal cycle outside a house in the Bradford area last September. James Bourne-Arton, defending, said the offence of child neglect was directly as a result of his 'long-standing drug addiction which is clearly the root of all of his offending'. His addiction had led him into a 'hopeless situation' over the last 10 years, he added. Recently Hanratty had been the victim of 'a serious assault' at his home following the publicity of the case involving his son's death, said Mr Bourne-Arton. He suffered a number of broken bones, had boiling water poured on his body and had clumps of his hair removed. His barrister said his client was planning to take advantage of drug rehabilitation programmes while in custody to address his problems. Judge Russell told him: 'Unless you do so there is really little hope for your future.'\n",

A failed businessman was found guilty yesterday of shooting his parents dead four months after trying to drown them in a staged car crash. Fraudster Stephen Seddon blasted them with a sawn-off shotgun after learning he was the sole heir to their £230,000 estate. The luxury car salesman, who had massive debts, also planned to kill his disabled nephew, but by a stroke of luck he was not at home. Guilty: Stephen Seddon, 46, left,  shot his parents at their home with this shotgun, right. He was found guilty of killing them and is facing life in prison . Convicted: A man with an 'insatiable thirst' for money was facing life in jail today for the cold-blooded 'execution' of his parents for his £230,000 inheritance. Patricia and Bob are pictured with Stephen . Manchester Crown Court heard the . 46-year-old had first tried to kill Robert, 68, and Patricia, 65, by . driving a hired BMW into a canal with them strapped in the back. Seddon smashed his way out of the car and was later hailed a hero for ‘rescuing’ his parents and nephew. Yesterday police admitted that ‘with . hindsight’ they should have spotted that the canal incident was staged . and ‘handled it differently’. Seddon had previously enjoyed a luxury . lifestyle, owning a Porsche 911 Carrera, an Audi convertible and a . chauffeur-driven Bentley. It was claimed his firm had an annual . turnover of £5million and at one time he had £2million in his bank . account. But his lifestyle came ‘crumbling down’ when he was convicted . of fraud in 2000 and he became financially reliant on his parents. Seddon, who rubbed shoulders with . high-flying businessmen and footballers, killed his ‘quiet, unassuming’ parents despite them giving him £40,000 and buying him a home. The court heard Bob Seddon, 68, suspected that a earlier car crash into a canal was an attempt by his son . to kill him and his wife Patricia, 65 . Tragic: The couple's bodies were discovered after a neighbour raised the alarm and police broke into their house in Manchester . Prosecuting, Peter Wright QC, said: ‘He was spending money as fast as he received it. He was in his parents’ debt and deeply so. 'He was heavily reliant on their generosity. He was the sole beneficiary of their estate and he knew it.’ On the day of his parents’ deaths, unemployed Seddon had just £5 in his bank account and had been applying to payday lenders. After the shootings, the defendant . planted the gun in his father’s lap to make it look like a . murder-suicide at their home in Sale,   Manchester. Shocking: Seddon had previously tried to murder his father, Robert, 68, and mother Patricia, 65, by driving into a canal with them strapped in the back seats in a fake road accident . Health problems: Patricia Seddon was left unconscious after the crash, and was rushed to a nearby hospital . But ballistics reports were ‘entirely . inconsistent’ with this version of events. It was also revealed that . Seddon’s nephew, Daniel, 17, had narrowly escaped death. Police found the shotgun was loaded . and it was alleged that Seddon had been expecting three people at the . house. Luckily Daniel was in respite care at the time. Happier times: Robert and Patricia Seddon are pictured on their wedding day . The day before the murders, Robert Seddon had warned his GP that his son was trying to kill him. He had grown suspicious when he noticed his son had watched a programme on how to escape from a sinking car on his Sky Plus box. Following the killings, police launched an internal inquiry into the canal crash. Yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector . Denise Worth said: ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and yes, looking . back now it could have been handled differently. ‘But at the time he came out of it as . a hero and it was treated like a tragic accident, but it was only after . the murders that we went back and looked at it in detail that we . realised things didn’t fit.’ Seddon’s first murder attempt took place on Mother’s Day last year at the Bridgewater canal in Timperley, Cheshire. Daniel managed to free himself and Seddon was seen on the roof of the car kicking the windows in and shouting for help. He told police he had suffered a heart . attack but hospital tests indicated he hadn’t. He also suggested the . car had hit a brick, but no debris was found. Four months later the father-of-three . of Seaham, County Durham, acquired a stolen shotgun from a contact in . Darlington before driving to his parents’ house. Police later found both victims had been blasted at close range. Seddon, who denied murder and attempted murder, will be sentenced today. Recovery: A salvage crew is pictured recover a black BMW car which Seddon drove into a canal in Timperley, Greater Manchester in an attempt to kill his parents . Stephen Seddon has become one of the very rare number of people whose greed drove him to the ultimate crime - not only murder but the murder of his own parents. For Seddon money was his 'whole world' and when he got it, he spent it fast. Even the lives of his mother and father were just an obstacle to overcome to get his grasping hands on cash. Close: Pat and Bob Seddon, pictured, had been married for 47 years . Detective Superintendent Denise Worth, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This job is probably one that is very, very difficult for anybody to contemplate. 'That anybody could kill their parents, to plan it, and to do it for money is indescribable. I cannot imagine that there are many people in the world that could do it.' Seddon was leaching off his parents' modest wealth for years before he murdered them.In one of the last acts of his life, his father paid his son's £60 speeding fine. His parents had already bought Seddon's home in Seaham, Co Durham to keep a roof over his family's heads. Seddon was supposed to pay his father rent - but it was not clear if money ever changed hands. Seddon grew up in Timperley, a Manchester suburb. His father worked for British Airways and the family were 'comfortable'. He began offending at the age of just 13, appearing before youth courts for offences of burglary, handling and theft. Grim: The bodies of the elderly couple were discovered after police were called to their home in Sale . Further convictions followed as an adult for taking vehicles without consent and he was jailed at Bolton Crown Court in 1989 for a series of offences including obtaining goods by deception, theft and making off without payment. He met his wife Nicola, an ex-model who is from the Sunderland area, in a lap dancing bar in Manchester 17 years ago and they moved to the North East. His offending continued and he developed a taste for the high life. He worked mainly in sales and in the late '90s set up a firm, European Business Support, providing grants to small businesses. The firm charged businesses £295 on the promise it would help secure European funding. His firm grew to an annual turnover of £5 million and he had £2 million in his bank account at one point. Ms Worth said: 'Seddon has had quite a lavish life in some respects. 'He has always had a fair amount of money. He has always had fairly well-paid jobs, so he has not had any financial difficulties. 'When he had his own company he had a really, really lavish lifestyle.' He bought a Bentley Turbo, hired a chauffeur and enjoyed jetting around the world, staying first class - again it was all just show. There were no European grants - he simply kept the cash. In 2000 Seddon pleaded guilty at Teeside Crown Court to fraudulent trading and was jailed for a year. In the weeks before killing his parents he was desperate for money, applying for high-interest, instant- access loans from various finance firms. On the day he carried out the killing he had just £5.45 in his bank account.\n",

The family of a filmmaker linked to an anti-Islamic movie has left their California home in the middle of the night to join the man in hiding. A . spokesman with the LA County Sheriff's Department said that Nakoula . Basseley Nakoula's relatives, each with his or her face covered, left their Cerritos home about 3:45am on . Monday. Deputies gave them a ride and they were reunited with Nakoula, . then taken to an undisclosed location. Family ties: The family of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula covered their faces as they were led out of his Cerritos, California, home early on Monday morning . Not under arrest: Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is escorted from his home by Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers in Cerritos, California on Saturday morning . Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the LA County Sheriff's Department, told ABC News: 'They decided they would be safer where they could move about and live a normal life. 'All we did was pick them up and reunite them with Mr. Nakoula.' He would not say when or if Nakoula and his family were planning to return - if ever. He told ABC: 'What we do know and what they told me is that for the time now and for the immediate future, for the weeks and months to come, they will not be returning to this address.' Nakoula . wore heavy apparel to disguise his appearance when he left his home . over the weekend. His family was no different, keeping their faces covered as they were led away by deputies. Meanwhile, as fresh protests broke out in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Reza Rahimi issued an stark message directed at Nakoula. Condemnation: Iran's Vice President Mohammad . Reza Rahimi (left) called for the filmmakers to be punished . while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (right) called on the West to take action . 'The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns... this inappropriate and offensive action,' Mr Rahimi said. 'Certainly it will search for, track and pursue this guilty person who... has insulted 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide.' Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also issued a statement, calling on the West to show it respects Islam by blocking the film. Casualty: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was one of four Americans killed in the Benghazi attack . 'They must prove they were not 'accomplices' in a 'big crime', he said. Nakoula was interviewed by federal probation officers, who . are reviewing a 2010 case in which he was convicted of bank fraud. Federal . authorities have identified Nakoula, a self-described Coptic Christian,  as the key figure behind 'Innocence . of Muslims,' a film denigrating Islam that ignited violence against . U.S. embassies in the Middle East. Nakoula later admitted that he produced the film with the help of his 21-year-old son, Abanob Basseley. The 14-minute clip on YouTube has sparked violence across the Muslim world. Violence began Tuesday when . mainly Islamist protesters climbed the U.S. Embassy walls in the . Egyptian capital of Cairo and tore down the American flag from a pole in . the courtyard. Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to . Libya, also was killed on Tuesday along with three other Americans, as . violent protesters stormed the consulate in Benghazi. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated . Press on Thursday that authorities had connected Nakoula to a man using . the pseudonym of Sam Bacile who claimed earlier to be writer and . director of the film. Nakoula pleaded no contest in 2010 to . federal bank fraud charges in California and was ordered to pay more . than $790,000 in restitution. The man behind it all: Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is escorted out of his home by Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers in Cerritos, California . He was also sentenced to 21 months in . federal prison and was ordered not to use computers or the Internet for . five years without approval from his probation officer. His attorney cited Nakoula's poor . health in a bid for leniency and home detention, stating his client . suffered from Hepatitis C, diabetes that require twice-daily insulin . shots, and other ailments that required more than 10 medications a day, . according to a transcript of the sentencing obtained by the AP. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies stand down the street from the suburban Los Angeles home of filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula . Many records in case remain sealed, . but prosecutors sought a longer prison term and noted that he misused . some of his own relatives' identities to open 600 fraudulent credit . accounts. Nakoula apologized during the proceedings and his attorney . James D. Henderson Sr. said Nakoula had learned his lesson. 'He's clearly gotten the message,' Henderson said. 'I can't imagine him doing anything stupider than what . he did here, but what's done is done.' Henderson said during the hearing that . his client had been enlisted by another man to open the accounts and . had only received $60,000 to $70,000 from the fraudulent transactions. Criminal record: Nakoula, also known as Sam Bacile, is pictured on the set of the controversial film 'Innocence Of Muslims' He got involved in the scheme after losing his job in the gas station . industry and had been forced to work for a few dollars a weekend at swap . meets to try to support his children and an ailing father, Henderson . said, according to the transcript. It could be difficult to establish a . probation violation case against Nakoula. In the federal court system, . the conditions of supervised release are geared toward the offense for . which a defendant was found guilty and imprisoned. In Nakoula's case, the offense was . bank fraud. His no contest plea was to charges of setting up fraudulent . bank accounts using stolen identities and Social Security numbers, . depositing checks from those accounts into other phony accounts and then . withdrawing the illicit funds from ATM machines. While it was unclear what might have . provoked authorities' interest, the filmmaker's use of a false identity . and his access to the Internet through computers could be at issue, . according to experts in cyber law and the federal probation system. Nakoula, who told the AP that he was logistics manager for the film, was . under requirements to provide authorities with records of all his bank . and business accounts. The probation order authorized in June . 2010 warned Nakoula against using false identities. Nakoula was told . not to 'use, for any purpose or in any manner, any name other than . his/her true legal name or names without the prior written approval of . the Probation Officer.' Federal prosecutors had charged that . Nakoula used multiple false identities in creating his fraudulent . accounts. Several, Nicola Bacily and Erwin Salameh, were similar to the . Sam Bacile pseudonym used to set up the YouTube account for the . anti-Islamic film. Other pseudonyms used in the accounts ranged from . Ahmed Hamdy to P.J. Tobacco. Media microphones are pictured outside the home of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula yesterday in anticipation of a statement from the filmmaker . Nakoula was also told he could not . have any access to the Internet 'without the prior approval of the . probation officer.' Nakoula was ordered to detail any online devices and . cellphones to authorities and was told his devices would be monitored . and subject to searches. Jennifer Granick, a criminal defense . lawyer who specializes in online crimes, said authorities might not have . been aware of Nakoula's online activity even if monitoring devices were . placed on his computers. 'That may be very hard for a probation officer . to catch ahead of time.' Granick also noted that Nakoula's . conviction for financial crimes might provide a basis for probation . officials to review bank and other monetary records. 'Somebody charged . with a financial crime might receive some supervision categories where . they might re-offend,' she said. Nakoula was arrested in June 2009, . pleaded no contest to the bank fraud charges a year later and was . released from federal prison in June 2011 after serving a 21-month . prison term, according to federal records.\n",

Huge pension pot: Ian Marchant (pictured) will get nearly £400,000 a year from the company when he leaves SSE in the summer . The man in charge of one of Britain's biggest energy firms will receive an annual pension pot of £400,000 despite the company being found guilty of ripping off one million customers. Ian Marchant will get the payout worth up to £9million after 10 years of working at the helm of SSE which has been hit with a £10.5million fine following an investigation by energy regulator Ofgem. Marchant, chief executive of the company, was paid just over £1million last year with a £158,000 'cash incentive' on top of his basic salary of £840,000. There have also been calls for the rest of the company’s management team to be sacked. On a day of shame for the power industry, SSE was attacked for ‘failing its customers’ through ruthless ‘mis-selling’, either on people’s doorsteps, over the telephone or on the high street. Hundreds of thousands of new . customers were attracted to switch from other suppliers at the height of . the racket – which lasted for three years – and many ended up paying . higher tariffs. While the fine is the largest-ever . handed out by Ofgem, it is a tiny fraction of the company’s profits. Last year, it made annual pre-tax profits of £1.3billion. As MPs and consumer groups said the scandal was ‘fraud’ and required a police investigation, it emerged that: . Scroll down for video . SSE headquarters in Perth has been handed the largest ever penalty imposed on an energy provider . Barry Gardiner, a Labour MP who also . sits on the energy select committee, said: ‘The activities that SSE have . engaged in appear to be nothing short of fraud. It would be appropriate . for the regulator to refer this matter for further investigation by the . police.’ Michael Fallon, the Energy Minister, said he had ‘rarely seen a . worse case of consumers being misled so badly’. Ofgem launched a probe in 2010 amid . claims families, pensioners and other victims were encouraged to switch . from their energy provider to SSE, lured by the prospect of saving . money. But in fact they were switching to a . deal with the company, formerly known as Scottish & Southern Energy, . which was ‘more expensive’. Pensioners Frank and Maureen Price, from . Rotherham, told how they were left with huge debts after being persuaded . to switch to SSE by a door-to-door salesman. Energy watchdog Ofgem said it found 'failures at every stage of the sales process' across SSE's telephone, in-store and doorstep selling activities . The couple were told they would make . substantial savings but have ended up paying hundreds of pounds extra . every year after their tariff more than doubled from £61 a month to . £158. Mr Price, 83, described their ordeal . as ‘distressing’ saying they can no longer afford to go on holiday and . have had to cut out all luxuries. In another case, a woman, who was . paying £1,600 a year for her energy bill, was told her bill would drop . to £1,423. In fact, it jumped to £1,734. Sarah Harrison, senior partner at . Ofgem, said: ‘SSE failed its customers, mis-sold to them and undermined . trust in the energy supply industry.’ Ofgem said SSE’s doorstep sales team . was managed by people who ‘received a commission on sales’. It said they . ‘therefore had a financial interest in not reporting misbehaviour’. Yesterday SSE said it has written to . around 970,000 of its customers who might have been misled into signing . up as an energy customer. It has set aside a compensation pot of around . £5million, and has already paid out around £400,000. The average payout . is around £65. Other customers who suspect that they . might also have been duped into switching to SSE were yesterday urged . to get in touch with the company with their grievance. SSE, based in Perth, said it was . ‘deeply regretful’ of its actions, which Ofgem said began in 2009 and . ended in September last year. Adam Scorer, director of policy at . Consumer Focus, said: ‘This is not a case of one bad apple. The problems . at SSE…represent a fundamental failure.’ Ofgem said it had decided against . referring the matter to the police because it had not found evidence SSE . had deliberately intended to mis-sell to its customers. Luciana Berger, the shadow minister . for climate change, said: ‘It would be completely unacceptable for the . energy bosses responsible for this scandal to get any kind of bonus when . SSE announce their financial results later this year.’ Tory MP Peter Lilley added: ‘If I were a shareholder, I would be very surprised if the top management remained in place.’ An M&S Energy spokesman said the . scandal has affected ‘less than one per cent of M&S Energy . customers.’ Unlike the majority of its rivals, SSE remains a . British-owned energy giant and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n",

Jailed: Crooked magistrate Simon Price, 45, masterminded a £1m VAT fraud to clinch multi-million property deals for his construction firm . A crooked magistrate who masterminded a £1m VAT fraud which helped him secure multi-million pound property contracts was jailed today. Simon Price, 45, was presiding over fraud and criminal cases whilst secretly creating bogus documents to make his construction firm look more profitable than it was. The fraudulent scheme with his long time business partner, who Price knew from childhood, helped clinch major deals to build properties in Lancashire. But clients were left with partially-finished developments in the Preston and Kirkham areas after Price's company Ice Blue Developments went into liquidation in 2011. Price - who served as a JP in Preston between 2004 and 2009 - was caught out following a routine inspection by taxmen when concerns were raised about the company's VAT returns. Documents were unearthed showing he and fellow company director John Smith had falsified invoices to claim VAT which was not owed. It resulted in more than £1m of taxpayers cash being paid out to them between September 2008 and December 2009. Price and Smith, also 45, had known each other for 35 years having been altar boys at their local church at the age of 10 and were godparents to each others children. Smith was best man at Price's wedding, but they fell out over the scam and have not spoken since. At Manchester Crown Court, Price, formerly of Lytham, now of Gretton, Gloucs, pleaded guilty to cheating the public revenue and 25 counts of making or supplying articles for use in fraud. He was jailed for 40 months and disqualified from being a company director for six years. He resigned from the bench in 2010. Smith, of Catforth, near Preston, who . was also a director at Jack Smith Builders was convicted of cheating . the public revenue and eight counts of making or supplying articles for . use in fraud. Magistrate: Preston Magistrates Court in Lancashire where Price served as a JP between 2004 and 2009 . He was jailed for three-and-a-half years in prison and disqualified from being a director for five years. Speaking after today's hearing, Simon De Kayne, assistant director criminal investigation at HMRC, said: 'This pair made incredibly crude attempts to falsify invoices and financial guarantees in a circle of fraudulent transactions. 'It was a complete cut-and-paste regime that unravelled as soon as HMRC officers investigated their business activities. 'The proceeds from the fraudulent VAT . repayments were diverted into their bank accounts in an attempt to . stave off their company's and own domestic debts. Partner: Father-of-three John Smith was jailed for three-and-a-half years for his part in the scam . 'The fact that Price was an acting magistrate at the time of the fraud makes it more shocking.' Earlier the court heard how Smith had studied building at Preston college and Price embarked on a career in design. Father-of-three Smith took on Jack Smith Builders, which had been established by his great grandfather, and in 1999 when he was approached to help build student accommodation in Preston he turned to Price for help. The project was a success and in 2003 they went into business for the development of land at Ashton Methodist church under the name Ice Blue Developments, with offices in the area. They then took on developments on the site of a disused petrol station in Freckleton, Preston, and secured a £3m contract for 20 apartments in Kirkham with New Fylde Housing. But victims of the pair included the New Progress Housing Group and student housing company Cosmopolitan. Work had started in September 2011 on a project with Cosmopolitan Housing with expected completion in August 2012. The company then became insolvent in December 2011 and work stopped, which meant university students who had expected to move in time for term were unable to. Cosmopolitan said this resulted in a loss in revenue of around £368,000. Smith and Price had their homes and offices searched. Price's laptop, which had drafts of false invoices from various firms on it, was seized. These include doctored invoices for building services received and faked correspondence from banks, solicitors and other institutions. The investigation uncovered letter headings from legitimate businesses that had been manipulated to create false documents. Examination of their email accounts showed Price and Smith referring to 'mickeying' up documents to suggest that Ice Blue was a reputable company and in good financial order to tender for contracts with local housing associations and to apply for bank loans. Sentenced: Manchester Crown Court, where Price and Smith were jailed and disqualified from being directors . Passing sentence Judge Patrick Field QC told Price: 'This was a saga which brought misfortune and significant damage on many others and you were the principal actor' in the frauds. 'I find you were very much in charge. You were responsible in the creation of the overwhelming majority of documents. 'You were very much in control of the monies fraudulently claimed from HMRC. It is clear that had this fraudulent scheme succeeded the reward would have been substantial. In mitigation for Price, defence lawyer Miss Lisa Robert, said: 'He has lost everything. For the first seven months of 2012 he and his wife were living as a family homeless, from pillar to post. 'For a number of years he and Mr Smith's friendship remained constant - but they are now sat next to each other in a dock separated by a few feet and the chasm that is now between them is one which cannot be breached.'\n",

Karen Culverwell fell for a smooth-talking serial conman who went on to swindle her out of 200,000 pounds . Despite spending a year in jail for duping four women out of their savings, Roy Moyse had not changed his ways. Within months of his release he  was trawling bars and nightclubs  for more lonely, vulnerable women  to fleece. So when he met Karen Culverwell, a divorcee who was about to receive a £245,000 settlement for her broken marriage, she made the perfect target. Pretending to be a successful businessman, the jobless gambling addict wormed his way into Mrs Culverwell’s affections, and soon the couple were living together. Thinking of him as her ‘rock’, she told Moyse all about her lucrative divorce settlement following the sale of the six-bedroom marital home she used to share with her company director ex-husband. Moyse, 45, persuaded her to let him set up an online bank account for her, and help handle her bills. In reality, the only person he helped was himself – to her cash. He swindled her out of £200,000 in two months, including £70,000 in one particularly lucrative week, blowing much of it in betting shops. Mrs Culverwell, 50, a housewife throughout her marriage who had limited computer skills, said: ‘I wish I had looked him up on the internet before I started a relationship with him, but it’s not something you think to do straight away. ‘I wasn’t that good on a computer at the start, I could just about write emails – nowadays I have much more knowledge. ‘Even when he set up my online banking I was reluctant because I didn’t know how to use it, which is why he organised the bills and had access to my accounts.’ She could have discovered the fraudster’s past online in seconds, as his previous crimes had been widely reported. A web search would have shown that Moyse was sentenced to three years in March 2008 for a string of similar scams dating back six years, including conning three women out of tens of thousands of pounds – and that he had even tricked a fourth woman by pretending to be a barrister while awaiting trial. He was released after 12 months. Mother of two Mrs Culverwell only discovered the fraud when she tried to buy a new home and was told by her bank that she had no money left. Every morning she had watched as Moyse walked out the door in a smart suit, thinking he was heading to business meetings. In fact, he had spent his days blowing her money in betting shops. Days after they split up, Moyse (pictured) emailed her a photo of himself stood against a new car, apparently bought with her money . The conman was jailed again for two years this week at Bournemouth Crown Court. Yesterday Mrs Culverwell, of Christchurch, Dorset,  branded him ‘completely heartless and disgusting with no conscience’. ‘You read about this sort of thing happening to other people and your first reaction is to think “what a stupid person”, and “what a fool to believe all that”,’ she said. ‘He was a calculating, professional conman and I don’t believe I had a chance. He has fooled people cleverer than me and lived in a fantasy life full of compulsive lies.’ Mrs Culverwell met Moyse in a bar, where they bonded over their appreciation of soul music. She had separated from her husband Robert amicably after 20 years in 2010. She moved out of the former marital home in June 2011, and shortly afterwards Moyse moved in with her. ‘He would leave the house suited and booted, telling me he was interviewing or having meetings. I had no reason to disbelieve him,’ she said. ‘I had no idea about the gambling. In fact, when I wanted to put a bet on the Grand National he told me he had never put a bet on anything.’ When she confronted him after discovering her account had been drained, Moyse kept lying, claiming he used the money to pay for work-related bills – and that he would reimburse her with a loan. When that never materialised, she contacted police. Moyse had spent Karen's money in betting shops (stock picture) when she believed him to be at work . Moyse was charged with six counts of fraud. Earlier this month he admitted one count relating to unauthorised bank transfers. The others, which involved credit cards, were left on file. Moyse, of Poole, Dorset, admitted swindling Mrs Culverwell out of £150,000, but he is thought to have benefited from more than £200,000 including loans she gave him that were never repaid. Mrs Culverwell, who has had to take a job as a sales manager, said: ‘Some days  I have no idea how I managed to stand up, let alone  work full time and care for  my family. ‘I loved and trusted this man and to think I allowed him to not only be in my life, but my daughters’ lives too, it makes me feel sick. ‘I am determined to make sure that no other woman falls into his trap. He has no right to destroy people’s lives and he has to be stopped once and for all. ‘I found the strength to come forward with the support of my family and friends and I hope other people who may have been affected by him will go to the police.’ Mrs Culverwell has complained to her bank over the irregular transactions, and the matter has since been referred to the financial ombudsman.\n",

Gina Lollobrigida’s ex-lover Javier Rigau told for the first time last night of his ‘devastation’ after the . Italian film star accused him of faking their wedding. He insisted that they had married in secret in 2010 and said he has never had any interest in Ms Lollobrigida’s £35 million fortune – substantiating his claim by revealing he signed two financial agreements before the wedding. The former screen goddess, 85, last week claimed he was a ‘vulture’ who duped her into marrying to get his hands on her money. But Mr Rigau, a Spanish businessman himself said to be worth £36 million, said: ‘It’s monstrous. She knows we are married and I have never been interested in her money. I am an independently wealthy businessman and I have earned every penny I own. We signed two financial agreements before the wedding. ‘One was a separation of assets, so although we are married we have our own independent assets. The second was a pre-nuptial agreement so I stand to earn absolutely nothing from the  marriage.’ Ms Lollobrigida has claimed to Italian police that she had discovered  Mr Rigau had used fake documents to carry out a marriage by proxy without her knowledge just over two years ago. In such a ceremony, an absent bride or groom’s vows can be spoken by someone else on their behalf. But Mr Rigau insisted they married out of love and enjoyed a healthy physical relationship despite a 34-year age gap. In an exclusive interview at his sprawling mansion in one of Barcelona’s plushest neighbourhoods, Mr Rigau, 51, claimed they were happily married, albeit secretly, until just two weeks ago. Mr Rigau said: ‘We have been together for almost 30 years and Gina wanted to get married. We were madly in love. ‘It’s devastating for me to hear her speaking about me the way she is. I am a very private person and I am only speaking about this because Gina has said some very hurtful things publicly in the press. ‘I believe she has been turned against me and against everyone else who loves her – her family and friends – by a new adviser. It breaks my heart to hear her speaking about me the way she is.’ MR Rigau’s claims add a new twist to a story so bizarre it is worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster. Ms Lollobrigida, once described as ‘the most beautiful woman in the world’, was one of cinema’s biggest names in the Sixties. The actress first met Mr Rigau, a debonair entrepreneur from Barcelona, at a party in Monte Carlo in 1984.Despite their age difference, they fell in love and had a passionate romance. The couple lived a glamorous, jet-set lifestyle, moving between homes in Rome, Sicily, Monte Carlo and Barcelona. They made plans to marry in New York in November 2006, and later changed the plan to wed in Rome in January 2007. But the wedding was called off because Mr Rigau could not cope with the media spotlight. To the outside world, the relationship was over. Leading man: Javier Rigau with Gina, left, and Maria Gabilondo, the woman who says she stood in for Gina at her wedding, right . But Mr Rigau, who drives a Rolls-Royce . Silver Cloud, now claims they could not bear to be apart and got back . together four months later, keeping their relationship secret to avoid . publicity. He said they decided to marry by proxy to avoid the media attention their previous wedding plans had attracted. That account is in stark contrast to the actress’s version of events. She . has accused him of being a fraudster who conned her into signing proxy . wedding papers in order to inherit her fortune on her death. Ms . Lollobrigida, who lives in Rome, revealed her claims about the ‘fake . wedding’ in an interview with an Italian newspaper last week. She . said: ‘This vile person married me by proxy, without my knowledge and . without my permission, in order to inherit my estate after my death.’ In . another interview with the Daily Mail, she said she wanted Rigau jailed . over the ‘fraud’. The . former sex symbol said she discovered the marriage after stumbling . across documents on the internet published by a disgruntled ex-business . partner of Mr Rigau. However, . Mr Rigau said Ms Lollobrigida flew to Barcelona in August 2010 with her . lawyer Giulia Citana to sign an agreement to marry by proxy. The papers . were signed in front of a notary at the five-star Princesa Sofia Hotel . near FC Barcelona’s Camp Nou football ground, he said. He added the proxy marriage took place on November 29, 2010, at the Sant Vicenc church in Sarria, where Mr Rigau lives. A . mutual friend, Maria Pilar Guimera Gabilondo, 72, from Barcelona, stood . in for the actress at the ceremony, which was attended by eight guests. Last night she revealed Ms Lollobrigida asked her to be her stand-in at . the wedding. Wedding venue: Mr Rigau says the couple got married by proxy at Sant Vincenc church in Sarria, Barcelona, in 2010 . ‘She asked me . to represent her at the church because she wanted to keep it secret . from the press,’ Mrs Gabilondo told a newspaper. Mrs Gabilondo said that she and Mr Rigau, who is a family friend in Barcelona, went with Miss Lollobrigida to see a notary to sign the legal papers. ‘Of course I thought it was strange that she didn’t want to attend her own wedding, but if a woman like that asks, you don’t say no,’ she added. ‘I’ve met her many times when she visited Javier in Spain and I’m astounded she now claims to know nothing about me or the wedding.’ Mr Rigau, whose full name is Francisco Javier Rigau y Rafols, said: ‘The idea Gina did not know she was getting married is preposterous. ‘She was as keen as I was to marry. That’s why she flew to Barcelona to sign the papers. ‘Unfortunately, over the past two years Gina has been getting some very bad advice. She has fallen out with her son Mirko, her 18-year-old grandson Dimitri, her lawyer and many friends. I was the last person left from her inner circle and now she has been turned against me. ‘I last saw her in Rome two weeks ago and everything was fine. She never mentioned any problems.’ Mr Rigau, who owns a property company in Spain,  says she is denying knowledge of the wedding because of the influence of her new manager , 25-year-old Andrea Piazzolla. Sizzling: Gina Llobrigida was one of the sex symbols of her day when she starred in films alongside Frank Sinatra and Humphrey Bogart during the 1950s and 60s . The mystery deepened on Friday when Ms Lollobrigida’s former lawyer, Giulia Citani, told The Mail on Sunday that the marriage did take place. Speaking from her office in Fiumicino, near Rome, she said: ‘You have to remember Gina is 85 so she sometimes has trouble remembering things but I can tell you she is legally married. There is legal documentation in Spain which proves that she agreed to be married and that the ceremony took place. ‘I don’t really want to go into too much detail as I can’t betray my lawyers’ oath – also I no longer represent Gina as we had a disagreement. ‘I accompanied Gina to Barcelona and documents were signed at the Italian consulate which authorised the marriage and this document was used for the marriage. ‘Gina is confused and perhaps doesn’t remember what happened.’ In Rome The Mail on Sunday approached Ms Lollobrigida’s 64-year-old son Mirko, from her first marriage to Slovenian Mirko Skofic, but he refused to comment.\n",

      "126. By . Rachel Rickard Straus . PUBLISHED: . 11:38 EST, 21 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:28 EST, 21 November 2012 . Four conmen who swindled £600,000 from the life savings of vulnerable and elderly people they built relationships with after approaching them on their doorsteps have been jailed for their ‘heartless’ crimes. The men, who had worked together for various building companies over the years, conspired to trick their victims into paying for expensive building works they did not need at ‘inflated prices’, Chester Crown Court was told. The scale of one the frauds, in which they tricked a victim into letting one of the gang buy his house for around £40,000 less than it was worth, was described as ‘breathtaking’ by Judge Nicholas Woodward, who said it was like something ‘glamorised by Hollywood films’. Conmen: Mark Dodd (left) and Neil Jones (right) were jailed for fleecing victims out of their life savings . Mark Dodd, 50, Neil Jones, 38, Kevin Sweeney, 37, and Paul Williams, 50, were jailed for ‘fleecing’ four vulnerable victims out of their life savings by gaining their trust and betraying them in the most cynical way, the court was told. Beatrice Price, a frail 80-year old when she was targeted, entrusted the defendant Jones with her finances after he tricked his way into her trust, only to have her accounts siphoned of almost £50,000 of savings. Williams, 50, forged 83-year-old Winifred Owen’s signature in order to write a cheque to his daughter for £14,750 after tricking his way into her home on a bogus visit to check her windows. He also did the same to Mrs Price on a separate occasion. Another victim - retired GP Dr Peter Grant - was tricked into dropping the price of his sister’s bungalow and their former family home, which he was selling for her because she had learning difficulties. Jailed: Kevin Sweeney (left) and Paul Williams (right) also fleeced victims out of their life savings, betraying them in the most cynical way . The property was subsequently bought by Sweeney for a fraction of its true value. Judge Woodward sentenced Dodd to five years, Sweeney to four-and-a-half years, Jones to four years and Williams to 18 months in jail. Andrew Thomas, prosecuting, told the court: ‘The defendants fall to be sentenced for their part in an overlapping series of frauds and thefts with a total value in excess of £600,000. ‘Their victims were private householders who were canvassed by them in relation to dubious building works. In each case, the defendants built a relationship of trust with the victim before using it either to commit fraud or theft.’ Dodd, from Liverpool, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to defraud but was found guilty by a Chester jury on October 1. The court heard Dodd is involved in the conspiracy in respect of building works for Dr Grant with a total value of £445,000. Salesman Neil Jones from Wirral, tried to pass himself off as a financial adviser. He admitted conspiracy to defraud Beatrice Price in respect of building works to the value £49,535. He has also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud Dr Grant in respect of building works to the value of £445,000 and conspiracy to defraud Dr Grant over the sale of the bungalow to the tune of £40,000. The total value of his fraud amounts to more than £534,535, Mr Thomas said. Justice: The conmen were handed jail sentences at Chester Crown Court . Paul Williams, 50, from Tranmere, worked for the other defendants as a self-employed salesman, apparently selling door-to-door, the court heard. Williams pleaded guilty to two offences: theft of £7,840 from Beatrice Price and theft of £14,750 from Winifred Owen. Married couple Kevin and Nicola Sweeney, 37 and 38 respectively, now live at the property formally owned by their victim Dr Grant. Fitter Kevin Sweeney, previously from Huyton, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to the same charges as Neil Jones. Local government worker Nicola Sweeney pleaded guilty to transferring the proceeds of the fraud committed on Dr Grant, worth around £57,000. Judge Woodward sentenced her to ten months in jail, suspended for two years. Judge Woodward branded the defendants ‘conmen’ who took advantage of others who were rendered vulnerable, ‘whether by old age or simple naivety’. 'This con was reminiscent of the type of activity that is sometimes glamorised in Hollywood films,' said Judge Woodward. He said their crimes were ‘calculated, deliberate and sophisticated’, adding: ‘You were ruthless in extracting every single penny you could.’ He said the gang carried on fleecing the victims ‘despite the fact you realised you were cheating people out of their accumulated life savings’. Judge Woodward added: ‘These were truly heartless offences and they left your victims both emotionally and financially bereft.’ Addressing the specific fraud on Dr Grant, in which the gang ‘played different characters’ in a bid to get him to lower the price of the house he was selling for his sister, Judge Woodward said: ‘Dr Peter Grant is a very decent man who has spent his life working for the community and helping to care for his disadvantaged sister who is the other victim of this charge. ‘The scale of the fraud on those people is simply breathtaking. This con was reminiscent of the type of activity that is sometimes glamorised in Hollywood films. ‘Each of you entered into the scene at different times playing different characters, all of whom appeared to be independent. The reality was, this was a cynical scheme to divest your victims of their life savings.’ He added: ‘This was the unscrupulous targeting of vulnerable victims in an organised and planned way over a long period.’ Dr Peter Grant’s sister, Carol Goldstone, suffers from a learning disability and now lives in supported accommodation, the court heard. Both are in their 60s. The gang carried out unnecessary work not only on the Chester bungalow but also on Dr Grant’s own home in Liverpool. ‘The total loss in respect of the building fraud on Dr Grant is about £445,000,’ Mr Thomas said.\n",

Hackers: Elvis Rafael Rodriguez (left) and Emir Yasser Yeje (right), of New York were arrested for the robbery . U.S. prosecutors untangling the aftermath of a $45million global cyber heist have released images of the suspected criminals' impressive  loot, including piles of cash, high-end watches and even a luxury car. Among the items seized from the seven men arrested in the U.S. Thursday were shopping bags from Gucci, a Porsche Panamera and a dozen fake credit cards. Meanwhile, German prosecutors said on Friday they had made two more arrests in connection to the case. A 35-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman, both Dutch citizens, were caught on February 19 withdrawing 170,000 euros ($220,500) in Düsseldorf using Bank of Muscat credit cards. In total, $2.4million dollars was withdrawn in seven German cities, the prosecutors said. On Thursday, U.S. prosecutors said an international criminal gang had stolen $45million from two Middle Eastern banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from cash machines in 27 countries. They allegedly used hacked debit-card data to make 40,500 transactions worldwide. The ringleaders of the global operation were believed to be outside the United States but U.S. prosecutors have declined to give details, citing the continuing investigation. Germany is the only other country so far to announce arrests. A spokesman for the Düsseldorf prosecutor's office said the two Dutch people under arrest had come to Düsseldorf with the purpose of withdrawing money in Germany. The two suspects are accused of computer fraud and faking credit cards. Germany's banking association, BdB, said it was not aware of any banks in Germany suffering losses as a result of the scheme.

The Department said seven of the men have been arrested. Terminated: Alberto Lajud-Pena, 23, allegedly the leader of the New York cell, was killed in the Dominican Republic on April 27 . Authorities said they arrested these seven U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New . York: Jael Mejia Collado, Joan Luis Minier Lara, Evan Jose . Peña, Jose Familia Reyes, Elvis Rafael Rodriguez, Emir Yasser Yeje and . Chung Yu-Holguin. Dominican police on Friday confirmed that the eighth, Alberto Lajud-Pena, allegedly the leader of the New York cell, was killed in the Dominican Republic on April 27. The 23-year-old suspect was gunned down during an attempted robbery in a house in the city of San Francisco de Macoris about 100 miles northeast of the capital, Santo Domingo, according to police. Investigators found $100,000 in cash in the house, as well as an M-16 assault rifle, two 9 mm pistols, a revolver, ammunition clips and a telescopic sight. The money and weapons belonged to Lajud-Pena, police said. Lajud-Pena, known as 'Prime' and 'Albertico,' was shot and killed by a gang of three men, of whom the leader was Carlos Manuel Jiménez, alias ‘La Vaca Loca’ (Mad Cow), according to police in the Dominican Republic. Jiménez and the two men were in custody, police said. It was not immediately clear if the gang or the $100,000 found at the house were linked to the cyber theft. U.S. prosecutors have said that $2million in cash is still missing from the heists. A man arrested in his death told authorities it was a botched robbery, and two other suspects were on the lam. Hot ride: This high-end Porsche Panamera with a price tag of up to $175,000 was seized from Evan Jose Peoa . Plastic: Prosecutors released images of a dozen fake credit cards seized from Peoa . According to court documents, Lajud Pena communicated via email with a Russian criminal organization that specializes in laundering money and wrote to his shadowy bosses in charge of the operation. He wired money and deposited cash into several accounts. ‘I sent scanned deposit slips,’ Lajud Pena writes in one. ‘Deposit has cleared. Order paid. Good job,’ the sender replies. Prosecutors said Lajud Pena recruited men he knew from Yonkers, some of whom worked as bus drivers for a company that provided services to special-needs students. Members of the global criminal . organization hacked into two credit card processors and used stolen data . to make the withdrawals, during two separate coordinated incidents in . December 2012 and February 2013, the Justice Department said. The . government charged eight individuals in New York with participating in . the larger scheme by withdrawing $2.8million in thousands of ATM . transactions, in what U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said was the . second-biggest bank robbery in the history of New York City. Caught at the ATM: Jose Familia Reyes was caught on camera on New York's Third Avenue making four withdrawals of $4,015 . ATM withdrawals: Jose Familia Reyes is caught on camera making large cash withdraws from various ATMs around Manhattan . Across town: Jose Familia Reyes makes more withdrawals on New York's Broadway . Lynch said it was likely that the . headquarters of the global scheme was located outside the United States . and that the current charges focused only on the New York-based cell. Investigators were examining whether other cells were operating elsewhere in the United States, she said. 'In the place of guns and masks, this cyber crime organization used laptops and the Internet. 'Moving . as swiftly as data over the Internet, the organization worked its way . from the computer systems of international corporations to the streets . of New York City, with the defendants fanning out across Manhattan to . steal millions of dollars from hundreds of ATMs in a matter of hours,' said Lynch, whose office in Brooklyn, New York, brought the case. The big heist: Jose Familia Reyes continues down Broadway in Manhattan, making cash withdrawals of over $2,000 from each ATM . Second biggest bank robbery in NYC history: Jose Familia Reyes was part of the international cyber hacking ring that stole millions . Part of the gang: Jose Familia Reyes was one of seven defendants, all U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New York . The case demonstrates the major threat that cyber crime poses to banks around the world. Security experts frequently identify electronic fraud as one of the key challenges facing banks today. 'Hackers only need to find one . vulnerability to cause millions of dollars of damage,' said Mark Rasch, a . former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, based in Bethesda, Maryland. In . the December attack, hackers gained access to an Indian credit card . processor that handled prepaid Mastercard Inc debit cards for National . Bank of Ras Al Khaimah PSC, or RAKBANK, according to a criminal . indictment. RAKBANK said on Friday the fraud against it took place at the end of last year and resulted in losses of around $4.7 million for the United Arab Emirates-based lender. Bank CEO Graham Honeybill said he believed the fraud went wider than lenders in the Gulf region. ‘We are given to understand that the overall fraud encompassed a number of banks not only in the Middle East but in the USA and other countries,’ Honeybill said in a statement. The amount of the potential loss for RAKBANK was 17.4 million UAE dirhams ($4.7million) and this had been fully provided for before it closed its 2012 accounts, Honeybill said. ‘The bank can confirm that none of its customers suffered any financial loss as a result of this fraud,’ he added. The incident related to events in December 2012 and involved the bank's service provider in India, he said, without naming the provider or giving any further details. In . February, the hackers broke into the system of a U.S.-based credit card . processor to steal account numbers for prepaid Mastercard debit cards . issued by Bank of Muscat, the indictment said. The second operation was far larger than the first attack, eventually totaling $40million in losses to Bank of Muscat. Evidence: Images from the iPhone of Elvis Rafael Rodriguez (left) show the hacker with Emir Yasser Yeje (right), of New York, along with cash and items bought with the stolen money . New York based ring: Charts showing information related to eight members belonging to a New York-based cell of a global cyber criminal organization are displayed at a news conference today . In . late February, Bank Muscat disclosed that it would take an impairment . charge of up to 15 million rials ($39million) because it had been . defrauded overseas using 12 prepaid debit cards used for travel. That charge was equal to more than half of the 25 million rials profit it posted in its first quarter ended March 31. The indictment does not identify the processor companies. Bank representatives could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours. In . both cases, the hackers boosted the available balance for each card and . eliminated the withdrawal limits, allowing them to take out huge sums . of money from ATMs in what prosecutors called an 'unlimited operation.' A . single account number, for instance, yielded nearly $9million in . profits, including $2.4million in New York City alone, prosecutors . said. The hackers . distributed the account numbers to coordinated 'casher' crews stationed . across the globe, who siphoned millions of dollars from ATMs within a . span of hours in December 2012 and February 2013.

One of the New York defendants was caught in surveillance footage from ATMs in Manhattan during the February operation, prosecutors said. After the cards were shut down, cashers laundered the proceeds, often by purchasing luxury goods, and sent a portion of the money back to the organization's leaders, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and bank accounts, as well as two Rolex watches and a Mercedes SUV, from the New York defendants. No individual bank accounts were compromised by the scheme, Lynch said. It wasn't immediately known which lawyers were representing the defendants.\n",
      "128. By . Bob Graham . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:07 EST, 15 June 2012 . A Texan tycoon who defrauded almost £5 billion from investors and used his wealth to bankroll international cricket matches in England was jailed for 110 years yesterday. Allen Stanford, who for 22 years ran investment scams with an estimated 17,000 victims, was once one of the richest men in America, worth more than £1.2 billion. The courtroom in Houston was packed with many of his victims to hear the sentence handed down, the majority of whom were small business owners. Two of the estimated 17,000 victims of Stanford’s fraud were allowed to address the court. Jailbird: Convicted financier Allen Stanford arrives at Federal Court in Houston for sentencing . Jaime Escalona, who represented Latin . American victims, addressed the hearing before turning to stare directly . at Stanford to tell him: 'You, sir, are a dirty, rotten, scoundrel.' The other victims’ spokesman, Angela . Shaw, of the Stanford Victims Coalition, said of the fraudster: 'Allen . Stanford has stolen more than billions of dollars. He took our lives as . we knew them.' She said some 28,000 people had lost money in the scam. Yet, even in his final hour of shame . the former tycoon couldn’t help but deny it all and to blame others. 'I’m not a thief.....I did not defraud anybody,' he said. 'The US government are responsible . ruining the business....they destroyed it and turned it to nothing. Stanford was a real brick-and-mortar global financial empire.' Guilty: Stanford was convicted in March of 13 of 14 counts of fraud . Stanford now plans to appeal against the conviction and sentence even though he was officially declared 'indigent' – penniless. The court has now to appoint lawyers . who will be funded out of a scheme similar to Britain’s own legal-aid . and it is estimated to run into tens of millions of dollars. During sentencing, . Stanford’s 40-minute rambling account was the first time he had actually . spoken to the court about what had taken place during the 22-years his . banking empire existed. He claimed he was a scapegoat and . blamed the federal government and a court-appointed receiver who took . over his companies in 2009 for tearing down his business empire and . preventing his investors from getting any of their money back. He said: 'I’m not here to ask for . sympathy or forgiveness or to throw myself at your mercy but I will tell . you I did not run a Ponzi scheme. I didn’t defraud anybody.' Stanford was once considered one of . the richest men in the U.S., with an estimated personal net worth of . more than £1.2billion. His financial empire stretched from the U.S. to . Latin America and the Caribbean. Calling Stanford arrogant and without . remorse, prosecutors said he used the money from investors who bought . certificates of deposit, or CDs, from his bank in Antigua to fund a . string of failed businesses, bribe regulators and pay for a lavish . lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of private jets and sponsorship . of cricket tournaments. Stanford added moments before being . led away: 'If I live the rest of my life in prison... I will always be . at peace with the way I conducted myself in business.' Disgraced tycoon Stanford’s schemes . were the second largest in US financial history – second only to Bernie . Madoff, the so-called ‘King of Con’ - who was given 150 years for his . £11.2-billion Ponzi scheme. The majority of the victims were small businesses or private investors, looking to cash-in on interest rates above bank rate. Cricket fan: The then Sir Allen Stanford poses with the England team during the Stanford 2020 Super Series match between England and Middlesex in 2008. He was later stripped of his knighthood . Cheeky: During the 2008 Stanford Super Series, the financier was photographed bouncing the wife of English cricket player Matt Prior on his knee . Happier times: Allen Stanford poses with Stanford Superstars following their victory at the end of the Stanford 20/20 Super Series match between England and Stanford Superstars in 2008 . Mike Bishop, of Houston, Texas, who . lost round £900,000 said outside the court: 'This was a wholesale . failure by government agencies who regulate companies such as Stanford. They are as responsible.

John Bullett, who was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court after he sent another man to take a DNA test to avoid paying child maintenance . A scheming father who sent another man take his DNA test so he could avoid paying child maintenance, a court heard. When the Child Support Agency asked John Bullett to prove he was the father of his son, he sent a stooge who presented himself as Bullett, signed a declaration and also had a picture taken. Leeds Crown Court heard the man, known only as Andrew,  took the test in the summer of 2012, looked nothing like 44-year-old and even had a facial tattoo, which Bullett doesn't. When the test came back negative . concerned mother, Danielle Roxburgh, was shown the picture of the . tattooed man and told the CSA it wasn't Bullet. Julia Harrow, prosecuting, told Leeds . Crown Court, West Yorkshire: 'She said she didn't know who the person in . the photograph was and she was 100 per cent sure Mr Bullett was the . child's father.' The court heard that when . interviewed, Bullet first said he had taken the test, and only later . admitted it wasn't him, saying he didn't know who the man who took it . was. A second DNA test taken by Bullett, of . Featherstone, West Yorkshire, while accompanied by two CSA officials, . finally confirmed he was the father of Miss Roxburgh's child. In interview Bullett, who previously . admitted one count of fraud, told police he knew the name of the man he . sent was Andrew but couldn't recall his second name. Miss Harrow said: 'He said he . [Andrew] had also had a sexual relationship with with Miss Roxburgh and . that man had taken the test and wanted to see if he was the father. Speaking today Recorder S Hirst said: . 'I take the the view Mr Bullett was very fortunate not be charged with . perverting the course of justice. 'You behaved in a despicable and . cowardly fashion. This was plainly a planned deliberate matter in which . Mr Bullett recruited another man to pull the wool over the doctors eyes, . the department and of course to avoid paying some money to this lady to . help with the upbringing of this child.' Bullett was sentenced to a six-month curfew and ordered to pay costs. The CSA were approached by Mis . Roxburgh in January 2012 to see if she could get child maintenance for . her lad who was two-years-old at the time. The court heard she had been in a . relationship with Bullet for around a year, splitting in September 2009, . while she was pregnant. The court heard that at point he denied . paternity. Leeds Crown Court heard the man, known only as Andrew, who took the test in the summer of 2012, looked nothing like Bullett . When the CSA tracked him down he again . denied being the father and initially denied knowing Miss Roxburgh, . later saying he didn't know her name and he had only met her a few times . in a club. Even when interviewed in late 2012 he . said Miss Roxburgh was 'sleeping with three other men at the time and it . was a one in three chance' it was his. Speaking at an earlier hearing at . Wakefield Magistrates Court, West Yorkshire, Chairman of the bench . Angela Beardshall said: 'There was the planning, the financial loss and . distress caused to Danielle Roxburgh.

This is the shoddy work of a cowboy builder caught in a TV sting after tricking homeowners into handing over 90 per cent of the payment upfront - and then leaving before the job is done. John Guerin, 56, left dozens of homes across London in a 'state of ruin' and in need of emergency structural repairs over a five-year period in a £370,000 rip-off. Many of the homes he targeted were left with gaping holes in walls or with full skips in the driveway which had not been paid for. Shoddy: A house is left without a roof and the metal beam exposed after the conman fled from a half finished job . Bodged job: An uninhabitable room left abandoned after most of the money had been paid upfront . Others had to be re-wired or re-plumbed because they work was unsafe. At one property Guerin had fled with the roof uncovered after the old one had been stropped away - but before a new one had been fitted. In another instance, foundations were laid for an extension and the first few layers of bricks were laid before the conman fled. Some were left in such a dangerous condition they were in peril of collapsing and homeowners had to stump up tens of thousands to get professional builders in to complete the job before they could move back in. Poor workmanship: An example of the shoddy work carried out by jailed conman John Guerin . Many owners had to re-mortgage their homes in order to pay for builders to come in and fix Guerin's shoddy work. John Guerin was jailed for five years at Croydon Crown Court earlier this month after being found guilty of 10 charges of fraud and one of obtaining money by deception. The conman, from Biggin Hill, Kent, targeted vulnerable people and after starting work convinced customers to hand over as much cash as possible before he vanished. The deception - which happened between 2006 and 2010 - was exposed on Channel Five's Cowboy Builders. In total, cowboy builders rip off homeowners by a staggering £260m a year, a study has revealed. According to research done by the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), people who pay builders in cash lose the equivalent of £712,000-a-day in shoddy work, which then has to be repaired. Jailed conman: John Guerin who was given five years behind bars for carrying out the £370,000 fraud . Caught out: John Guerin, right, is confronted by TV presenter Dominic Littlewood as his scam comes undone on Cowboy Builders . A spokesman for the FMB, the largest trade association in the UK building industry with a membership of 12,000 building firms, said that paying for work in cash was ‘dangerous’. The research by the FMB showed that of the 1,000 people quizzed in the poll, a total of 11 per cent said they had ended up with shoddy workmanship which they then needed to get redone. Of that 11 per cent, 76 per cent had paid in cash - showing that using ready cash to pay builders was more likely to lead to poor quality work. Brian Berry, spokesperson for the FMB, said today: 'Before employing a builder, it is vital to carry out checks to make sure you are using someone reputable, such as an FMB builder. 'Choosing your builder on price alone can be a false economy which may neither add value to your property nor make for a smooth building project.' Extension going nowhere: The first few layers of bricks had been made when Guerin abandoned this building site . George Clarke, the presenter of Restoration Man on Channel Four, said: 'If you pay a builder large amounts of cash upfront then you leave yourself vulnerable to them increasing the price or walking off the job half-way through and you don't have any warranty if it all goes wrong. 'By using a reputable builder, signing a contract, and organising staged payments with receipts, you will have recourse if it all goes wrong.' Many of Guerin's crimes took place in the London Borough of Bromley. After he was jailed, Bromley Borough Council released photos of some of his shoddy building work. The council said Guerin traded under a range of company names, including Bluewood Constructions Ltd, Greyfox Project Management and Merlyn Refurbishment Ltd, before he was snared. Rubbish job: A load of building waste left outside one house after work was left undone . Mess: A doorway has been cut out but left unfinished, rubble is piled up outside, wiring has not been done and the room, left, needs decoration . In one case, Guerin was asked to build an extension for a man suffering from Parkinson's disease, but left with the project in a 'total mess' after getting more than £20,000. Sentencing Guerin to five years in jail, Judge Heather Baucher said: 'It beggared belief that he would inflict such harm. 'Nothing will compensate the victims for the distress and misery caused.' The court heard how the total amount paid by victims was £370,000 - but that with the increased costs of getting the job done properly meant victims would be 'left considerably out of pocket'. Bromley Council added that it had made an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize Guerin's assets. Councillor Tim Stevens said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case and the time is now conducting a financial investigation into any financial gains made so the council can seek to recover any sums that were overpaid. 'The outcome of this case sends out a very strong message that we will not tolerate criminals preying on Bromley residents and our trading standards team is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.' During his appearance on Cowboy Builders, Guerin was challenged by Mr Littlewood about the quality of his workmanship. The show is co-presented by former glamour model Melinda Messenger.

Police are hunting for a girl of 14 who has disappeared with a 35-year-old convicted fraudster. Lorna Vickerage ran away with ‘family friend’ John Bush three days after being taken from home and placed in foster care by social services. Detectives urgently want to trace the ‘vulnerable’ teenager and are concerned about Bush because he is known to be a ‘liar, fraud and cheat’. Scroll down for video . Missing: Schoolgirl Lorna Vickerage (left), 14, and former car dealer John Bush (right), 35, both of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, are thought to have been in the Highfields area of the town over the past two days . South Yorkshire Police say they do . not know what his motives are for going off with the girl, but he is . wanted for abduction of a child. Lorna’s mother and father have appealed for her to hand herself in and stressed she is not in trouble. Her father, Darren Griffiths, urged . her to come home. ‘She’s quite independent,’ he said. ‘She’s usually . quite sensible. But, obviously, I don’t know exactly what’s going off in . her head at the minute. ‘She’s quite mixed up. There’s been a lot going off lately. I just don’t know what she’s thinking.’ Mr Griffiths spoke about his daughter and Bush in an interview with ITV. ‘I think they are in some kind of . relationship or something is going off between them,’ he said. ‘No one . would go to the extremes he’s going to. 'I just want her to come home. Everybody is worried about her and we want to know where she is' Darren Griffiths, Lorna's father . 'He’s been warned to stay away from . her but he hasn’t done.’ Her mother, Christine Vickerage, 36, wrote on . Facebook: ‘my baby plz come home darling we love u so much.’ Beside a picture of her daughter, she . posted: ‘this is my gawgess lovin daughter if anyone as any idea were . she could be would u plz contact me I just want her home safe thankyou.’ Scene: Police arrived at where Lorna Vickerage was staying and found the TV on and the back door open, missing them by minutes . Mr Griffiths and Miss Vickerage are . no longer together. Lorna, from Doncaster, is believed to have met Bush . at a caravan site, near her home, where he is thought to live. 'Please come home my gorgeous girl. Am so worried about you. I love you so much' Christine Vickerage, 36, Lorna's mother . She went missing after leaving the . Outwood Academy in Adwick, Doncaster, on Monday in her school uniform. The last sighting of the pair was at 10.15am on Wednesday in Highfields, . Doncaster. Detective Chief Inspector Craig . Robinson said Lorna was introduced to a couple as Bush’s daughter and . ‘appeared to be safe and well and chatty’. Police believe that they may be . travelling in a silver Ford Mondeo, registration number Y753 CSH, which . Bush had borrowed and not returned. School: The teenager was last seen on Monday at 2.30pm at Outwood Academy (pictured today) in Adwick in her school uniform, although South Yorkshire Police said it was unlikely that she will still be wearing this . Bush, who is single, is a family . friend. He has convictions for dishonesty and was given a suspended . prison sentence earlier this year for frauds, including failing to . return courtesy cars to garages and failing to pay for a holiday . cottage. ‘What does concern me is he’s a liar, he’s a fraud, he’s a cheat and it’s what he’s telling Lorna,’ said Mr Robinson. ‘She is with a man three times her . age who has no parental responsibility for her. He should not be with . her. Where has he taken her, what’s he doing with her?’ In a message to the teenager, Mr . Robinson said: ‘Lorna, you’re not in trouble. Your mum’s petrified, . we’re concerned for your safety. Let us know you’re safe and well.’ Questions: South Yorkshire Police Detective Chief Inspector Craig Robinson (centre) spoke to reporters at a press conference this morning outside Doncaster Police Station over the disappearance of Lorna . Lorna Vickerage is on the run with a man who sparked a nationwide manhunt two years ago. After he was found, John Bush was said in court to have spun a web of lies from Hertfordshire to Yorkshire, as he conned his way to thousands of pounds worth of goods and services. He managed to get a  courtesy car from a Watford garage while his non-existent Porsche 4x4 was being ‘repaired’, before driving the £13,000 borrowed car north then abandoning it near York. The ‘professional fraudster’ also asked a Thirsk garage to carry out £1,800 of repairs to another car he did not own, drove off in a second courtesy car and never went back to pay, the court heard. Bush was given a 14-month suspended jail sentence in February this year for fraud, as well as 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £3,400 in compensation to some of his victims. At the time of the frauds, he was said to have been homeless and in financial trouble. He had been in a relationship with a drug addict, but this had then ended and he was caring for an elderly man.\n",

Ringleader: Gordon Coe recruited four accomplices to dupe unsuspecting Brits out of at least £26,000 by pretending to be charity collectors . A gang of bogus charity collectors who stole at least £26,000 from thousands of generous Brits were today jailed for a total of more than nine years. Ringleader Gordon Coe, Pauline Hunt, Susan Christians, husband and wife Kim and Ben Chapman duped unsuspecting donators by shaking fundraising tins for Marie Curie Cancer Care. But instead of giving the cash to help needy cancer patients, they pocketed the money. For three years the con artists toured pubs and clubs across the south of England with fake charity tins and ID badges and urged revellers to donate money. Thousands of people dug deep in the belief they were helping pay for vital palliative care nurses for dying cancer patients. Instead, it was a sickening scam to fund the group's lavish lifestyle, a court heard. All but one of them lived off benefits, unable to work, but still flew off on holidays together in the Dominican Republic, Tenerife and Greece. One of the money launderers themselves even admitted they were ‘the most evil b******* going’. Prosecutor Nicholas Tucker estimated the fivesome, led by Coe, pocketed more than £26,000, based on 260 trips yielding an average £100 each. But more than £40,000 of unaccounted for money was also found in their bank accounts. A judge today jailed them for at least a year each and Coe to four years, to deter others from ‘even thinking about such a scheme’. Charity con artists: Coe's accomplices included Pauline Hunt (right) who had an unexplained £4,753 in her bank account and was jailed for 12 months, and Susan Christians (left) who had £4,454 unaccounted for and was jailed for 18 months. She told police that the group was 'the most evil bastards going' Judge Derwent Hope, Honorary Recorder of Southampton, said the gang had shown ‘little or no remorse’ for scamming a ‘wonderful charity’. He said: ‘This is a shocking case of fraud in which the public and a charity have been abused. ‘No one will ever know the true loss to the Marie Curie fund.I am satisfied they are a wonderful charity who bring relief to terminally ill people and their families, while properly accounting what they receive from generous donors. ‘That is why at the heart of this case there has been a massive breach of trust from each one of you, not just to the members of the public you targeted in public houses but also the Marie Curie fund you defrauded. Pocketed charity money: Husband and wife Ben (right) and Kim Chapman (left) also laundered money pretending to be collectors for Marie Curie Cancer Care. Ben was jailed for 15 months while Kim got a 20 month sentence . ‘I sentence you not only to punish you who have committed these crimes but also to deter anyone else from ever thinking of such a scheme.’ Southampton Crown Court heard Coe, a former pub landlord from Southampton, Hampshire, masterminded the cruel conspiracy in an ‘almost professional’ way, Judge Hope said. Coe applied to become a Marie Curie fundraiser in November 2008, filling in the paperwork and supplied two referees to say he was an honest man. One of these was family friend Chapman, 43, who later joined his money-grabbing team. After passing the vetting process, Coe was sent charity T-shirts, a volunteer fundraiser ID card and a paying-in book to help him collect around the city. A local Marie Curie fundraising manager visited Coe, now 65, to give him about 12 collection tins and lay down their strict regulations. He was forbidden from recruiting others to help him or collecting from pub-to-pub, rules he brazenly ignored. Coe (pictured arriving at court) and his accomplices showed 'little to no remorse' for scamming a 'wonder charity' Judge Derwent Hope said . Coe, an amputee, then rounded up his four accomplices to raise money for ill-gotten gains. He gave them fake ID badges from the charity, tins with home-printed logos and even forged letters of gratitude from the area's fundraising manager. After a night's collecting - travelling to Brighton and even London - the crew would return to Coe's flat to split the takings among themselves. They collected so much that Christians bought herself a washing machine, paid for entirely in coins. Coe took the bulk of the proceeds. Over three years, he put just £263 into the charity bank account, but deposited £31,348 into his own. Coe pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and concealing financial transactions - a trawl of his bank accounts revealed unexplained cash deposits of £31,348 dating back to 2009. He was jailed for four years and 44 months, to be served concurrently. Sentencing Coe, Judge Hope said: ‘You made out you were someone honest the charity could trust and they provided you with all manner of materials. ‘You almost totally abused that trust by providing them with a miniscule amount of the money you and your co-defendants took. ‘You recruited a team of collectors who took up matters enthusiastically in an extensive tour from Bristol to Brighton and even to London and the Home Counties to target public houses.’ Coe was in and out of hospital from September 2010 to July 2011, following a heart attack and the other four carried on collecting on their own, the court heard. Even after the game was up, the fraudsters claimed they took only £20 to £30 petrol money and other ‘expenses’ at the time. Alarm bells first rang in January 2010, when a customer at a Southampton pub challenged Hunt, 55, as she asked for money with a battered charity tin, clutching a tatty ID badge. Outside court: Kim Chapman, Christians and Ben Chapman (left to right) deceived people by making them think they were helping pay for vital palliative care nurses for dying cancer patients . The suspicious customer also rang Marie Curie with his suspicions and concerned charity bosses alerted Hampshire Police as they did not have a woman registered to collect in that area. Organisers also tried to get in touch with Coe, who did not answering their letters and calls. In March, he eventually admitted he knew Hunt and had given her permission to empty tins on his behalf. Police dropped the case as no crime had apparently been committed and the scam grew, with the gang convinced they had the perfect system. Driver Chapman, an electrician, ferried his 45-year-old wife and Christians, 65, from pub to pub to ask for money. When a pub patron challenged Hunt (pictured) as she asked for money, he became suspicious and called the charity who realised they did not have a woman registered for the area . Chapman, the only one with employment, . told police he thought he was earning himself a 'gold star' by doing a . good turn for society. A search of his bank accounts found £445 in unexplained deposits. He was jailed for 15 months. Detectives discovered £860 unaccounted for in his unemployed wife's bank accounts and she was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and converting criminal property. She was given 20 months jail on each count to be served concurrently. Coe's first recruit, Hunt, had an unexplained £4,753 stashed away in her bank account and jurors found her guilty of converting criminal property. She was jailed for 12 months. Christians, 65, of Dibden, in New Forest, had £4,454 in her bank that could not be accounted for. She cracked under police interview and admitted what had happened, saying: ‘I know it's a nasty thing to do but I've done it, I've got to live with it' adding they were “the most evil bastards going”.’She was jailed for 18 months. A Marie Curie Cancer Care spokesman said: ‘We would like to reassure people this type of incident is extremely rare. ‘We shouldn't let one bad apple give legitimate charity collectors a bad name. ‘The vast majority of collectors are trustworthy and dedicated and, as a charity, we couldn't raise the vital funds we need without them. ‘Generous donations enable Marie Curie Nurses to provide free care to people with terminal illnesses in their own homes and in the charity's hospices.’\n",

Hissan Dar was jailed for three and a half years after stealing £110,000 from a couple with learning difficulties . A gambling-addicted bank cashier who stole £110,000 from the account of a couple with learning difficulties was jailed for three-and-a-half years today. NatWest worker Hissan Dar, 26, persuaded Stephen and Frances West to give him their cash card after promising to protect them from fraud. Dar then took money from the couple, who he had advised for years, when they received a £200,000 inheritance from Mr West's mother. Dar, who had worked for the bank for ten years and earned a £26,000 salary, told them he was paying their bills, managing their cash and paying into a funeral plan for them. Instead he spent £36,000 on roulette machines and bets on horse racing at a Ladbrokes store yards from the branch he was working at in Richmond, southwest London. Dar also made cash withdrawals totalling £68,000 and £3,000 of credit card purchases, as well as applying for thousands of pounds of loans. He was finally caught when other cashiers noticed suspicious activity on the West's account. When he was arrested, he tried to claim the Wests had blown the money themselves on an extravagant lifestyle. He later admitted fraud and was jailed at the Old Bailey for what Judge Timothy Pontius described as a 'deliberate and mean-minded' scam. Judge Pontius said: 'You deliberately . targeted the account and therefore the very modest income of a . thoroughly decent couple who had reposed a high degree of trust in your . handling of their financial affairs. Gambling addict Dar pictured leaving a shop after using one of the bank cards. He blew their money on bets and roulette machines and then tried to blame the couple for leading an extravagant lifestyle . Dar, pictured at the Old Bailey, gained the trust of the couple and then used their money to fund his gambling addiction . 'They . relied on your professional acumen and advice to a significant degree . given their learning difficulties and obvious lack of familiarity with . the complexities of managing an account in a time of fiscal constraint . and uncertainty.' The Wests have been refunded by NatWest and the judge said the bank should be commended for this. But he added: 'That financial loss is . perhaps less significant to them than the undoubtedly shocking effect . upon them of learning that the man in whom they had so completely placed . their trust over a period of years had disgracefully abused that trust . to such an extent.' The . court heard Mrs West, in her 50s, had learning difficulties and poor . eyesight, while Mr West, in his 60s, also had 'below average' intelligence. Both worked part-time in a poppy factory. Prosecutor Juliet Oliver said: 'They are physically quite frail as well. 'But Mr and Mrs West have always endeavoured to live as an independent couple as best they can, although they do receive support in the community. 'Their main aim is to try and avoid being thought of as stupid. 'They believed bank employees were not only trustworthy but able to assist them in organising their financial affairs.' Their trust was shattered on June 29 last year when they went to NatWest to withdraw money. 'They explained they needed more than the £200 cash Mr Dar had allowed them to cover the period he was away on holiday,' said Ms Oliver. 'They didn't have their cash card as Mr Dar held them, he said to protect them from fraud. 'Staff did a check and saw £300 had been withdrawn earlier that day through an ATM. 'There was a pattern of recent withdrawals in sums of hundreds of pounds. Dar worked as cashier at the NatWest branch in Richmond. The bank has refunded the money to the couple . Dar spent tens of thousands gambling on roulette machines (right) and horse racing at the Richmond Labrokes . 'When asked, the Wests said it was probably Hissan. They refused to believe anything could be amiss with their accounts. 'Such was their trust that they actually telephoned him that evening.' Further investigation showed huge amounts of money had gone missing since March 2011, with a large chunk spent on gambling. Mr West said he had only ever bet £5 on a horse race and £4 on the Eurovision song contest. When he was arrested, Dar claimed the Wests had spent the money themselves, telling police they ate out at restaurants three times a day. He later owned up, but claimed he had been trying to support his family after his father was laid off. Madeleine Wolfe, defending, said: 'He is perhaps not a callous or devious man but a man who lost control of his finances and turned in desperation to criminal activity. 'He is thoroughly ashamed of himself, as he ought to be.'\n",

Sixteen people have been arrested and seven of them charged with fraud after allegedly targeting elderly and vulnerable people in a £1million rogue trading scam. Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate launched an investigation in December into reports an organised crime gang was cold calling people in the Clacton area of Essex. Seven people were charged last night . with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation . between 2009 and 2013. The charges relate to work carried out on . victims’ homes at inflated prices. The seven month investigation is believed to be one of the biggest in England and Wales into conspiracies targeting elderly people. Sixteen people have been arrested after seven month investigation into an alleged £1million rogue trading scam . About 39 people, aged 65 and 99, are believed to have fallen victim to an organised gang and were together conned out of hundreds of thousands of pounds. A team of 65 officers were involved as suspects were arrested at addresses in the Colchester and Clacton areas yesterday. Unemployed William Brown, 48, of Colchester, and company director James Brown, 20, of Tiptree, have also been charged with one count of blackmail and one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property. Unemployed Peter Biddle, 66, of Ardleigh; builder Van Purdy, 59, of Ardleigh; and pawnbroker Harvey White, 48, of Clacton, were all also charged with one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property. The suspects were arrested on suspicion of . crimes including conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit money . laundering, and suspicion of money laundering . Builder James Brown, 44, of Stanway, was also charged with one count of blackmail, one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property and one count of fraud by false representation. All six men have been detained in police custody prior to their appearances at Colchester Magistrates’ Court later today. Nurse Rachel Poole, 47, of Bromley . Road, Ardleigh, has been released on police bail until her first court . appearance on July 16 when she will face the main charge of conspiracy . to commit fraud. The remaining nine arrested people, . aged between 26 and 62 and from the Epping, Colchester and Clacton . areas, have been released on police bail until next Wednesday. Gary Beautridge, Essex Police assistant . chief constable, said: 'Over the past seven months my officers have . been investigating a series of cases which appear to be the work of an . organised crime group taking advantage of the elderly and vulnerable and . exploiting them for criminal gain. 'The offences we are looking at basically amount to the financial abuse of the most vulnerable members of our society. 'The . evidence would suggest that these vulnerable people have been groomed . and then preyed upon by a group whose sole intention appears to be to . line their own pockets.' The force said it had been working with Essex County Council’s trading standards and adult social care departments. At least 39 people, aged between 65 and 99, are believed to have fallen victim to an organised gang . Police have arrested six men on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, one woman and one man on suspicion of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and seven people on suspicion of money laundering. The suspects are all in custody in police stations in north Essex. Following the arrests, police and trading standards warned residents not to have work carried out by people knocking on their door and instead seek quotes from reputable tradesmen. Essex County Council today said rogue doorstep traders can be extremely persuasive and target elderly and vulnerable people. Essex County Councillor Roger Walters, cabinet member for trading standards said: 'The arrests today demonstrate that we will not tolerate the unacceptable and abhorrent behaviour of those who prey on the most vulnerable members of our community.

A man knocked down his £500,000 former home in less than an hour because he faced eviction, a court has heard. Christopher McGowan, 50, allegedly used a hired JCB to demolish the rear ground floor wall of Silver Bow Farm in Greenbottom, near Truro, Cornwall. His actions left the property structurally unsound after prosecutors claim he smashed through doors, kitchen and bathroom units. A jury heard that when McGowan went on the wrecking spree he also removed all the fixtures and fittings from the house. Christopher McGowan is accused of demolishing a wall at the back of his former home making the building structurally unsound . During his alleged wrecking spree McGowan also removed all the fixtures and fittings from the house . From the front the house looks okay, but it is a wreck after McGowan allegedly became angry when a million-pound property deal fell through . It is alleged that he wanted ‘to punish’ the new owners of the house after a million-pound property deal went sour. Truro Crown Court was told that he had already been evicted from the house and land after it was sold to Janet Taylour for nearly half a million pounds. Philip Lee, prosecuting, said McGowan had been declared bankrupt in 2009 and was in negative equity with debts of more than £500,000. He was setting up a £1million deal with Wycliffe Estates, managed by Mrs Taylour’s son, Christopher Taylour but it fell through when he failed to disclose his bankruptcy. McGowan, pictured outside Truro Crown Court, has been accused of wrecking his £500,000 old house with a mechanical digger 'to punish' the new owners . It then emerged that he did not even hold the legal title to the property and was due to be evicted in September 2010. Mrs Taylour bought the property for £470,000 in February 2011 from McGowan’s mortgage lenders. He was allowed to remain living there but could not pay his rent and an appeal against the eviction order failed in July 2012. Mr Lee said the following month he hired the JCB from a nearby construction firm and returned it within an hour. He told the court: 'On August 16 he hired a digger and returned it within 40 minutes. The nature and extent of the damage is such that it can only have been done deliberately. 'The defendant has the motive and the . inclination to punish the Taylours. He must have been responsible for . the damage. There is no other reasonable explanation.' Mr Lee added: 'It’s the Crown’s case . that by then the defendant was in an angry and desperate state of mind . as a result of being unable to meet his mortgage. 'The defendant had hopes of making a . significant financial gain but in the end he was not in a position to . sell the property. He was not in a position to negotiate any deals.' The court heard that Mr Taylour went to the house later the same day and found extensive damage. Mr Lee said: 'The rear ground floor wall had been destroyed rendering the property structurally unsound.' The . jury were handed photographs of the scene showing that doors, kitchen . and bathroom units and fixtures and fittings had all been removed. McGowan, . of Chacewater, Cornwall, denies two counts of causing criminal damage. The jury had heard he has admitted fraud and forgery connected to the . case. The case continues. The court heard McGowan had already been evicted from the house and land after it was sold to Janet Taylour for nearly half a million pounds .

A bogus lawyer has been sentenced 14 years in prison for duping 'desperate and vulnerable victims' into thinking he was a bona fide legal professional. Giovanni di Stefano, 57, became known as the Devil’s Advocate for taking on 'unwinnable' cases  with a client list including road rage killer Kenneth Noye and timeshare fraudster John ‘Goldfinger’ Palmer. Despite no legal training, the fraudster managed to win some of his cases. But his high-flying legal career was brought to an abrupt end when he was convicted of 25 charges including deception, fraud and money laundering between 2001 and 2011. Behind bars: Giovanni di Stefano, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court ahead of his sentencing for fraud, was today jailed for 14 years . No ordinary lawyer: Giovanni di Stefano built up a reputation for defending the seemingly indefensible. Now he has been convicted on 25 charges including deception, fraud and money laundering . Today di Stefano, who was briefly a director of Dundee FC in 2003, pleaded guilty to another two counts of fraud and a further three counts were ordered to lie on file at London’s Southwark Crown Court. As he stepped out of the dock after hearing his sentence, di Stefano told the judge in a loud voice: 'I am obliged, my Lord'. Judge Alistair McCreath, the Recorder of Westminster, noted there were many offences over significant periods of time. He said the fact that the victims, which included a disabled man seeking damages for the loss of an arm, were all 'desperate and vulnerable' and faced losses which were not just financial but also included the 'raising and dashing of false hope' were aggravating factors. The 57-year-old conned clients out of millions of pounds by setting himself up as a lawyer when he had no legal qualifications and was not registered to work as a lawyer in Italy or the UK. He used the Italian word 'avvocato' on business cards, letterheads and identification documents to give . clients - and the judiciary - the impression he was an advocate. Giovanni Di Stefano as he arrives back at Southwark Crown Court to face charges of fraud . Giovanni di Stefano has represented some of Britain's most notorious criminals . Giovanni Di Stefano acted for Patrick 'Dutchy' Holland, a career Irish criminal, best known for being the first person accused of killing Irish investigative journalist Veronica Guerin, which he denied until his death . The judge told di Stefano: 'I recognise . that you did not actively seek out those whom you defrauded. They came . to you. You did not approach them but there is more than one kind of . predator. 'Some predators hunt down their victims, others lie in wait for them. 'Your victims in this case were all desperate people and people who, because of their desperation, were vulnerable.' The judge also noted that, while this case is about money, 'it is also . about something different and great - it is about the real distress you . caused to so many people'. 'You had no regard for them nor for their anguish,' he said. 'Your only concern was to line your own pockets.' During the trial, di . Stefano told of his links to Robert Mugabe, Osama bin Laden, Saddam . Hussein and his 'friendship' with the daughter of Slobodan Milosevic. The . court was shown a 2004 BBC documentary in which he described Saddam as a . 'nice guy' and boasted of being asked to defend killers such as Jeremy . Bamber, Harold Shipman, Kenneth Noye and Linda Calvey. He . was born in the small town of Petrella Tifernina in central Italy, but . moved to the UK as a boy and went to school in Wollaston, . Northamptonshire. Prosecutor . David Aaronberg QC had told the jury that di Stefano had gained fame . for handling clients 'whose cases others considered unwinnable or too . difficult to defend'. But he did in fact win some cases, overturning a manslaughter conviction against Nicholas van Hoogstraten in 2002 and getting him released from prison. In 2003, Di Stefano secured the release of John 'Goldfinger' Palmer from prison on a technicality, with only a fine of £33million for timeshare fraud, which Palmer later avoided paying. Not best director: Di Stefano was briefly on the board at Dundee . Former Dundee director Giovanni di Stefano (right) pictured at a press conference with team manager Jim Duffy (left) and new signing Fabrizio Ravanelli . Pop guru Jonathan King (centre), who was convicted of a series of sexual assaults on teenage boys, with his lawyer Giovanni di Stefano . The harm that di Stefano inflicted was 'in financial terms alone high', said the judge. But he added: 'In terms of emotional harm, it was much greater - the building of false hopes, always and inevitably dashed, followed by years of misery and frustration as they tried to recover what you had stolen and in the end were forced to come to terms with their financial loss.' The judge said di Stefano had 'lied' to his victims about what he was capable of and who he was. His crimes were 'planned and persistent' and some of his attempts to defend his behaviour in court amounted to 'breathtaking cynicism', the judge noted. Di Stefano, of North Stream, Marshside, Canterbury, Kent, was found guilty of nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, eight counts of fraud, three counts of acquiring criminal property, two counts of using a false instrument, one count of attempting to obtain a money transfer by deception, one count of obtaining property by deception and one count of using criminal property. Today he pleaded guilty to stealing £150,000 compensation that should have gone to a man who had lost an arm in a car crash. The money was due as part of an insurance policy but di Stefano had it paid in to his business account and 'duly stole it'. The court was told it was a 'wicked' crime and is one which 'stands in a league of its own'. The bogus lawyer also admitted defrauding engineer David Brown and his family of £160,000 including the £75,000 life savings of his partner's mother. This case also involved £20,000 costs which were not paid out. Due to the 'utterly wrong' advice that di Stefano gave him - 'to protect your own position' - he lost his home and his job.\n",
      "137. By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:36 EST, 25 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:18 EST, 26 July 2013 . Four Russian nationals and a Ukrainian have been charged with running a sophisticated hacking organization that penetrated computer networks of more than a dozen major American and international corporations over seven years, stealing and selling at least 160 million credit and debit card numbers, resulting in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. Indictments were announced Thursday in Newark, where U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman called the case the largest hacking and data breach scheme ever prosecuted in the United States. Princeton-based Heartland Payment Systems Inc., which processes credit and debit cards for small to mid-sized businesses, was identified as taking the biggest hit in a scheme starting in 2007 — the theft of more than 130 million card numbers at a loss of about $200 million. Scroll down for video . Dmitriy Smilianets, left, is in U.S. custody and expected to appear in federal court next week, while Albert Gonzalez, right, is currently serving 20 years for stealing credit card numbers . Atlanta-based Global Payment Systems, another major payment processing company, had nearly one million card numbers stolen, with losses of nearly $93 million, prosecutors said. The indictment did not put a loss figure on the thefts at some other major corporations, including Commidea Ltd., a European provider of electronic payment processing for retailers. The government said hackers in 2008 covertly removed about 30 million card numbers from its computer network. About 800,000 card numbers were stolen in an attack on the Visa network, but the indictment did not cite any loss figure. Not all the companies the hackers infected over the years with malicious computer software suffered financial losses. Customer log-in credentials were stolen from Nasdaq and Dow Jones Inc., the indictment said, though prosecutors said Nasdaq's trading platform was not affected. The indictment said the suspects sent each other instant messages as they took control of the corporate data, telling each other, for instance: 'NASDAQ is owned.' At least one man told others that he used Google news alerts to learn whether his hacks had been discovered, according to the court filing. The defendants were identified as Vladimir Drinkman, 32, of Syktyvkar, Russia (PDF), and Moscow; Aleksander Kalinin, 26, of St. Petersburg, Russia (PDF); Roman Kotov, 32, of Moscow; Dmitriy Smilianets, 29, of Moscow; and Mikhail Rytikov, 26, of Odessa, Ukraine. Smilianets is in U.S. custody and was expected to appear in federal court next week. His New York-based lawyer, Bruce Provda, said Smilianets was in the U.S. ‘sightseeing’ when he was arrested. ‘It's a rather complex international charge of hacking,’ Provda said. ‘If it goes to trial, it's going to be a lengthy trial.’ Drinkman is being held in the Netherlands pending extradition, prosecutors said. His lawyer there, Bart Stapert, did not immediately return a message. The other three defendants remained at large. Princeton-based Heartland Payment Systems was identified as taking the biggest hit ¿ the theft of more than 130 million card numbers at a loss of about $200 million . The prosecution builds on the 2009 case that resulted in a 20-year prison sentence for Albert Gonzalez of Miami, who often used the screen name 'soupnazi' and is identified in the new complaint as an unindicted co-conspirator. Other unindicted co-conspirators were also named. In the Gonzalez case, which focused on the theft from Heartland - at the time the biggest breach of its kind ever discovered in the U.S. - Kalinin and Drinkman were charged as 'Hacker 1' and 'Hacker 2.' Prosecutors identified the two as sophisticated hackers who specialized in penetrating the computer networks of multinational corporations, financial institutions and payment processors. Kotov's specialty was harvesting data from the networks after they had been penetrated, and Rytikov provided anonymous web-hosting services that were used to hack into computer networks and covertly remove data, the indictment said. Smilianets was the information salesman, the government said. All five are charged with taking part in a computer hacking conspiracy and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The four Russian nationals are also charged with multiple counts of unauthorized computer access and wire fraud. The individuals who purchased the credit and debit card numbers and associated data from the hacking organization resold them through online forums or directly to others known as 'cashers,' the indictment said. Atlanta-based Global Payment Systems had nearly one million card numbers stolen, with losses of nearly $93 million . According to the indictment, U.S. credit card numbers sold for about $10 each; Canadian numbers were $15 and better-encrypted European ones $50. The data was stored on computer servers all over the world, including in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Latvia, the Netherlands, Bahamas, Ukraine, Panama and Germany. The cashers would encode the information onto the magnetic strips of blank plastic cards and cash out the value, by either withdrawing money from ATMs in the case of debit cards, or running up charges and purchasing goods in the case of credit cards. The charging documents unsealed Thursday show instant message chats between Gonzalez and Kalinin about hacking into Hannaford's systems. When Kalinin jokes about the breach being reported on TV news, Gonzalez advises him to set up Google news alerts, like Gonzalez says he has, for 'data breach' 'credit card fraud' 'debit card fraud' 'atm fraud' and 'hackers.' The gang stole about 800,000 card numbers in an attack on the Visa network . 'It's how I find out when my hacks are found,' Gonzalez says. Gonzalez jokes, 'Hannaford will spend millions to upgrade their security!! Lol' And Kalinin replies: 'they would better pay us to not hack them again.' Kalinin was also charged, along with another Russian man, in a separate indictment unsealed in New York on Thursday. The men are accused of hacking into computer systems at Citibank and PNC Bank and giving co-conspirators information who encrypted blank ATM cards that were used to withdraw $4.2 million from customer accounts in 2006 and 2007. Kalinin is also accused in that indictment of installing malicious software on Nasdaq computers. Prosecutors say the breach did not affect securities trading.\n",

The wife and daughter of a man who were found guilty of his murder and dubbed the 'lady killers' have had their convictions quashed by the Court of Appeal. Shirley and Lynette Banfield argued there was no evidence retired bookmaker, Don Banfield, who was last seen in 2001, was even dead and that he could be among the 2,000 people-a-year who disappear. Three of the country’s top judges today agreed with their lawyers that - with no body, no suggested mechanism of death and no indication even of the date when Mr Banfield was allegedly killed - his wife and daughter simply had ‘no case to answer’. Lynette Banfield (left) and her mother Shirley (right) argued there was no evidence the bookmaker was dead . The jury’s murder verdict was quashed and the women will not face a retrial. Shirley, 65, was last year found guilty by a jury at London’s Old Bailey of enlisting her 42-year-old daughter’s help to kill with Mr Banfield, 63, and profit from his death. Mr Banfield, from Wealdstone, in north-west London, who was reputed to be a heavy gambler and womaniser, had recently retired when he disappeared. After completing the contract for the sale of his home for £179,000 in May 2001, he was never seen again. Crown lawyers argued the mother and daughter had a financial motive and acted 'in concert' to dispose of Mr Banfield. Never found: Don Banfield disappeared more than a decade ago . The jury found both women, who lived together in Thanington, near Canterbury, guilty of murder by a 10-1 majority in April last year. The pair, who had earlier admitted fraud offences in relation to the plundering of Mr Banfield’s £64,000 pension fund, were each jailed for life. However William Clegg QC, for Shirley Banfield, told London’s Criminal Appeal Court it had not even been proved that Mr Banfield was dead. He said: 'The evidence proved that Don Banfield disppeared over the week-end 12/13th May 2001. 'The Crown did not suggest when, where or how he was killed, who was present, the mechanism of death or what happened to the body.' He added: 'Two hundred thousand people disappear each year and 2,000 of those are not heard from again. Don Banfield could have been one of those 2,000.' Overturning the women’s murder convictions, Lady Justice Rafferty said: 'This was an alleged joint enterprise murder with no body, no suggested mechanism of death, no identified day when the murder was said to have occurred, no time and no place and no suggestion of what happened to the body.' Lynette and Shirley Banfield arriving for their murder trial at the Old Bailey last year . Although Mr Clegg had accepted that the likelihood was that 'one or other' of the women killed Mr Banfield, the judge said there was simply no evidence on which any rational jury could conclude that they had acted together to kill him. Crown lawyers argued the woman had both the opportunity and motive for murder, but the judge emphasised: 'Suspicion without more does not equate to proof'. One woman might have had trouble killing Mr Banfield single-handed and disposing of his body. But the judge, sitting with Mr Justice Simon and Mrs Justice Carr, said: 'The courts regularly see proved allegations of homicide against a woman acting alone'. The judge ruled: 'The submission of no case to answer should have been allowed. These appeals will be allowed and both convictions will be quashed'. She added: 'For the most evident of reasons there could be no question of a retrial'.\n",

High flier: Victoria Sadler took up burlesque dancing to counterbalance her £150,000 city job . After a decade in a high-flying job in the City, Victoria Sadler thought she had seen and heard it all: traders who used their expense accounts to take clients to strip clubs; colleagues openly mingling with prostitutes and vile sexist language bandied about on a daily basis. There was the 40-year-old trader who had a heart attack and died at his desk. And another who threw a tantrum in the office – sweating profusely and sniffing constantly then screaming ‘you bitch’ at her before he smashed her phone against the wall. He had not even bothered to wipe the tell-tale smudge of white powder from his nose. So when the disenchanted internal auditor took up burlesque dancing – swapping austere daytime suits for pink sequins, spangles and feathers in the evening – she never suspected it would end her £150,000-a-year career. Now, instead of auditing the professional behaviour of traders, Victoria has adapted their characteristics to feature in her routines. In one dance she begins dressed as Michael Douglas’s unscrupulous Wall Street trader Gordon Gekko and morphs into Madonna’s Material Girl in a basque covered in bank notes. She works under the name Victoria L’Etoile and performs for an audience dominated by men – but one over which she says she has total control. ‘When I took up burlesque in 2003 I was working at Merrill Lynch,’ says Victoria, 36. ‘I liked it because it countered the testosterone-fuelled environment of my working life. ‘Even though I was the pudgy, pasty-faced girl in the corner of the burlesque class I appeared to have a talent for it. I did keep it secret from the bank. Compared to the behaviour of those around me on the trading floor, it seemed a harmless hobby.’ But in 2008, when she was working for another major bank, a colleague sent an email to her employers containing a video clip of her performing at Soho cabaret bar Madame JoJo’s. Pressure: Victoria says drugs are rife among city workers under immense stress . Victoria had just been promoted but was accused of bringing the firm into disrepute – a charge which carried the threat of instant dismissal. ‘I was in shock,’ Victoria recalls. ‘I cried, broke down and rang my lawyer. The sheer hypocrisy of it was just astonishing. The banks quietly condone the poor behaviour of male traders but I was being faced with the sack.’ It was September 2008, the time of the financial crisis. ‘You would have thought the banks had more to worry about,’ she says. But Victoria was subjected to a painful and painstaking eight-month-long investigation. The final 200-page report from the bank’s human resources team, who had studied the video of her dancing, included comments that she stroked her leg during her act, and that her breasts ‘wobbled’ when she danced. ‘They pulled everything out of context,’ Victoria says. ‘They made it seem smutty.’ In September the following year she finally left in disgust, forced out by the ‘sexist’ bosses who refused to discipline her colleagues. Exposed: Victoria was disciplined when it emerged at the bank that she was also a burlesque dancer . Today she is more interested in her performances and has transformed her act to bring comedy – and her experiences of banking – into her act. ‘My audiences are a mixed crowd of men and women – the women “get it” when there’s satire and comedy, which after all is in line with the origins of cabaret. It’s very gratifying.’ Victoria is also releasing an explosive new book, Banking On Burlesque, in which she lifts the lid on what really takes place on the trading floors of the City’s biggest banks. She claims that at Merrill Lynch male colleagues openly boasted they were going to clubs to ‘get some slags’, and that one of her managers – a  married man with children – invited her into his office and wanted her to mark him out of ten for his naked body. There were also sexist insults on the trading floor. ‘The big screens on the trading floor were supposed to show news clips but they were showing women’s aerobics, on a loop,’ she said. Far more seriously she was appalled to discover fraudulent traders creating fake trades to boost apparent profits to secure their jobs and their bonuses. ‘I audited one trader who later was investigated by the bank. The sum involved was around £300 million,’ she said. ‘I was then told that was the fifth trader who had been investigated for suspected fraud that year.’ She claims drug taking was rife. ‘I never saw the traders take drugs, but I witnessed their behaviour,’ she says. ‘They weren’t taking drugs in a party way, it was to survive and cope with the stress.’ The eldest daughter of an architect father and mother who is a nurse, Surrey-born Victoria opted for a career in the City in 2000 after gaining a politics degree from Manchester University. ‘I never saw the traders take drugs, but I . witnessed their behaviour. They weren’t taking drugs in a . party way, it was to survive and cope with the stress.' Victoria Sadler . ‘It was one of the few jobs that paid enough to allow me to move out of home and buy a flat on my starting salary,’ she concedes bluntly. ‘I do think I was perhaps naive.’ But by 2002, when she was working as an internal auditor for Merrill Lynch, she was beginning to dislike the sexism and policies she saw on the trading floor. ‘I am a bolshie and brusque personality so I assimilated with the culture quite easily,’ she said. ‘But then there was a big sex discrimination case brought by Stephanie Villalba who had been the head of the private wealth division. She was the only female head of a department. Out of the blue she resigned and sued Merrill Lynch. ‘It was at that point that the scales began to fall from my eyes. Because I worked in internal audit I was responsible for investigating traders. I realised that every trader I saw had been white, and male.’ Around the same time Victoria was up for a pay review and had been discussing with a male colleague, who did the same job and got the same promotion, what their salaries and bonuses were likely to be. Glamour: Victoria as her burlesque alter ego Victoria L'Etoile, left, and her book, right . When he came out of the manager’s office he triumphantly revealed the figures, expecting she would get the same result. But when I went in the figures were different,’ she said. ‘He had got £60,000 and a bonus and I had £57,000. We had the same performance scores and reputation. ‘When I told the boss I knew about this he was furious and said we shouldn’t have been discussing it. They later offered to pay me more – even more than my colleague – as long as I kept quiet about it. ‘I thought, “Wow this sexist stuff does really exist.” It was the first clue I had that I would have to fight to be treated equally. ‘Merrill Lynch was like a boys’ club where everyone was trying to do the Gordon Gekko thing.’ 'The pressure on the traders was . immense. They looked like sick dogs who didn’t know how to . get out. They were cannon fodder and their behaviour was erratic.' Victoria Sadler . But if Merrill Lynch was a boys’ club, Victoria says the other bank was ‘a grim treadmill’. ‘The pressure on the traders was immense,’ she said. ‘They looked like sick dogs who didn’t know how to get out. They were cannon fodder and their behaviour was erratic. ‘Later, when I had my own discussions with my bank’s human resources department over my burlesque show, I talked about what I had seen in the industry. ‘I was told that there was no evidence that traders went to strip shows and no evidence that they took drugs. I was staggered.’ But had Victoria never considered her double-life as a performer might create problems? ‘No,’ she says. ‘But when I told my mother I had taken up burlesque she was appalled, and she gave me a warning:  “Watch who you tell.” ‘It wasn’t that she thought it was shameful, but I should beware of other people’s prejudices.’ After being forced out of the bank, Victoria got an 18-month contract with Goldman Sachs, where she felt that despite the devastation of the credit crisis ‘nothing much had changed’. Yet she insists, despite conceding she faces an uncertain future as  a writer and a dancer, that she has no regrets. ‘I enjoyed working in banking for a time,’ Victoria said. ‘But I’m much happier doing burlesque now and working on books. ‘In banking I felt I was losing my identity as a woman. I don’t want to go back to that hell. It was a world of abuse, sexism, ruthlessness – I felt like I was wasting my life. ‘Now burlesque has freed me from that. And the women in this world are bold and assertive – unlike the few pretty little female assistants you meet on the trading floors. ‘I’m 5ft 8in and a size 14 but burlesque is not about how you look. And my role models here are women who don’t need to take any crap.’\n",

The former Goldman Sachs trader known as 'Fabulous Fab' is liable in a massive mortgage securities fraud case, a New York City jury found today. The Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Fabrice Tourre of scheming to sell investors subprime mortgage securities that he knew would fail. Authorities said the maneuver allowed a hedge fund and its billionaire president, John A. Paulson, to make $1 billion by betting against the investment. Tourre, a known party lover who grew up in France and moved to the U.S. in 2000 to study at Stanford, insisted at the trial that he never misled anyone. His attorneys portrayed him as a scapegoat in the economic downturn which they said was caused by larger economic forces. Scroll down for video . Verdict: Former Goldman Sachs vice president Fabrice Tourre, center, leaves Manhattan federal court with his attorneys on Thursday after he was found liable in a massive mortgages fraud case . Tourre, 34, found liable in six of seven SEC fraud claims. He faces potential fines and a possible ban from the financial industry. The exact punishment will be determined at a future proceeding. Speaking with the Wall Street Journal, Tourre said that he knew the case would haunt him. 'I'm . not naive,' he said. 'It's going to stay with me forever... You cannot . erase Google searches. You will forever get the same articles, forever . get the fabulous Fab.' The SEC had accused Tourre of misleading institutional investors about subprime mortgage securities that he knew were doomed to fail, setting the stage for a valued Goldman hedge fund client, Paulson & Co. Inc., to secretly bet against the investment. The maneuver ended up making $1 billion for the hedge fund and its wealthy president, John A. Paulson, and millions of dollars in fees for Goldman. Liable: French-born Tourre, 34, now faces potential fines and a possible ban from the financial industry . The SEC also sought to show that it helped earn Tourre a bonus that boosted his salary to $1.7 million in 2007. SEC lawyer Matthew . Martens told the jury in the trial, which kicked off two weeks ago in New York, the deal Tourre put . together was 'secretly designed to maximize the potential it would fail' to the benefit of the hedge fund. 'In the end, Wall Street greed drove Mr. Tourre to lie and deceive,' Martens said. On the witness stand, the SEC lawyers confronted Tourre with a January 2007 email it said deliberately misled another institutional investor about Paulson's short position in the investment called Abacus 2007-AC1. Asked repeatedly if the information in the email was 'false,' Tourre responded, 'It was not accurate.' Under fire: Fabrice Tourre (3rd from L), is shown in this courtroom sketch in Manhattan Federal court . He added: 'I wasn't trying to confuse anybody; it just wasn't accurate at the time.' Leaving . the courtroom on Thursday, SEC lawyer Matthew Martens said, 'We're . obviously gratified by the jury's verdict and appreciate their hard . work.' Satisfied: After the verdict, litigator Matthew Martens said he was 'gratified' by the result . Tourre left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. His attorney also had no immediate comment. In . closing arguments, Martens called Tourre's testimony 'surreal, . imaginary, unreal, dream-like' and told jurors that the defendant wanted . them 'to live in his imaginary land ... to live in a fantasy world.' 'Only if you close your eyes to the facts, you can find Mr. Tourre not liable for his actions,' the SEC lawyer said. Tourre's attorney, John Coffey, countered that the government had 'unjustly accused him of wrongdoing.' Coffey urged jurors to put the investment's failure in perspective, noting that all similarly packaged securities \"went off the cliff as well\" after 2007. Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, said the SEC was trying to turn her client into a 'scapegoat'. 'This is not a case about whether you approve or disapprove of Wall Street,' she had said. The civil case had been called the most significant legal action related to the mortgage securities meltdown, but it lacked the drama and high stakes of white-collar criminal cases. Much of the testimony was devoted to the intricacies of synthetic collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs - a complex type of investment central to the case. Some of the testimony focused on a personal email Tourre sent to his girlfriend in France. Bourgeoisie: Fabrice Tourre reportedly 'loved to party' and claimed to be from a prominent French family . The SEC lawyers said the missive proved the hubris of a man at the center of a massive fraud, while the defense claimed was \"an old-fashioned love letter\" penned by a young trader who was full of self-doubt and angst over upheaval in the financial world.

Tourre left the firm in 2012. Workplace: Tourre started working for Goldman Sachs in New York, pictured, in 2001 but is now pursing a PhD . Tourre told the Journal that he had never intended to work on Wall Street but moved up the ranks after landing the job at Goldman in 2001. In 2009, he was called to meet with the SEC about a deal he'd helped structure and a year later, a colleague told him there was a news story about the SEC filing a complaint against him and Goldman. 'It was a shock,' he said. Before he testified to a U.S. Senate subcommittee, he learned Goldman had released his emails to the public. 'They took certain steps that immediately didn't make me look good,' he said. 'But did I understand why they took those steps? Of course I did.' He said he is now looking forward to returning to the University of Chicago, where he is working towards a degree in economics. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.\n",

Unwitting trail: Olena Tischenko, the Ukrainian friend of a fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted over a $5billion bank fraud, pictured in London before leading detectives to his hideout in the south of France . A fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted over a $5billion bank fraud was tracked down to a French villa when a glamorous female friend unwittingly led detectives hundreds of miles to his hideout. Mukhtar Ablyazov was held yesterday after paramilitary police swooped in on a luxury home in the town of Mouans Sartoux, near Nice in south-east France. He is wanted in Kazakhstan on charges of siphoning off at least $5billion from BTA Bank, which based in the central Asian country's business capital, Almaty. The 50-year-old has been wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan over a string of allegations of fraud and organised crime since fleeing the country for London in 2009. He disappeared from the UK in February 2012 just before a British court sentenced him to 22-months in jail for contempt of court in a financial fraud trial. Sources say he was finally found when his blonde Ukrainian friend Olena Tischenko was spotted outside the High Court in London by private investigators hired by BTA on July 22. She had attended a hearing defending legal action brought by the bank. She left court shortly before 6pm and took a taxi to the Cornhill in the city before hailing a second cab to Heathrow. At 10.30pm, she boarded a flight to Nice, where she was driven to her home. There, she changed into a mini skirt and high heels and drove off around an hour later to the luxury Villa Neptune in Miramar on the Cote d'Azur. She parked away from the villa and walked to the property at 3.07am, it was reported by The Evening Standard. Around half an hour later, Ablyazov for spotted for the first time rearranging the bed in his underwear. Ms Tischenko left the villa at lunchtime the following day to go to the beach before flying from Nice to Moscow that evening. Investigators staked out Villa Neptune until Ablyazov drove to one of his other villas, saint Basile in Mouglis last Friday. Mr Tischenko joined him there that evening and stayed the night. The bank then contacted the French authorities on Monday to inform them they had found Ablyazov, who is wanted under an Interpol notice issued by the Ukraine.

His daughter, Madina, is pictured outside the courthouse of Aix-en-Provence during his extradition hearing . He later went to another of his . properties, the 1816 Chemin de Castellaras in mouans-Sartoux, where he . was surrounded by French special forces. The police used 'powerful means'  - . including armoured vehicles and a plane - because Ablyazov was known to . have a 'private militia' at his disposal, said Ms Legras, whose office . focuses on international cases. In the event, no shots were fired during the operation. Ablyazov, . who has been wanted by Interpol since 2009, was held on allegations of . 'large-scale fraud in an organised group', Ms Legras said by phone, . shortly after meeting with Ablyazov to explain the possible extradition . process. A former energy . minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent . opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled . the energy-rich Central Asian nation since before the Soviet collapse. Shortly . after setting up a pro-reform party in 2001, Ablyazov was sentenced to . six years in prison for abuse of public office. However, he was pardoned . by Mr Nazarbayev and released in 2003, vowing to stay out of politics - . a promise he broke by funnelling money to the opposition.

Dante Dixon, 45, from Miami, Florida and Christopher Henderson, 32, of Akron, Ohio were both arrested on Monday in Ohio after authorities discovered their ruse. They face wire fraud charges. The two men made at least four flights between May and June after contacting Jet Aviation, a business aviation provider based at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and claiming to be top execs. Under the name 'Josh Stevens', they provided a fake email address they said was linked to the company - and were able to tap into a sham $350,000 line of credit issued by the company. High life: Dante Dixon and Christopher Henderson allegedly claimed to be bank execs to set up a $350,000 line of credit with Jet Aviation, which is based in Teterboro, NJ (pictured), for private jets . A man using that name called Jet Aviation's offices in Chicago, Illinois and Van Nuys, California in May to enquire about its private charter flight services, according to the criminal complaint released by the FBI. In the draft charter agreement, which was signed after being sent to the fake email, Dixon was listed as a vice president . and Henderson as a vice president of international affairs of the company. Jet Aviation was never paid for $164,911 spent on the charter flights between California, Ohio, New Jersey and Miami or $10,879 for limousine services used between May and June this year.

      "143. By . James Chapman and Kirsty Walker . UPDATED: . 05:06 EST, 19 January 2012 . Reviled: MPs have demanded Fred Goodwin, whose bank had to be saved with billions of taxpayers' money, be stripped of his knighthood after a highly critical report of the FSA . Disgraced banker Sir Fred Goodwin faced growing calls last night to be stripped of his knighthood. David Cameron is ‘sympathetic’ to cross-party demands for the most reviled figure of the financial crisis to lose the honour bestowed on him for ‘services to banking’. Sir Fred steered the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse. His bank had to be kept afloat with £45billion of taxpayers’ money and is still 83 per cent owned by the state. Following a highly critical report by the Financial Services Authority, MPs say Sir Fred’s case should now be referred to a secretive Whitehall body responsible for investigating whether honours should be revoked. Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood is the most senior member of the Forfeiture Committee, which is responsible for ensuring the honours system does not fall into disrepute and can ask the Queen to remove official awards. Since 1995, it has recommended that 34 people are stripped of their honours, including Zimbawean tyrant Robert Mugabe, former world boxing champion Prince Nazeem Hamed, who was convicted of dangerous driving, and Jean Else, a Manchester headmistress accused of nepotism and mismanagement. Miss Esle was made a dame for services to education had her honour revoked in February 2011 – two years after being found guilty of misconduct by the General Teaching Council. She was dismissed following claims of ‘nepotism’ and was found guilty of failing to observe minimum standards in recruiting and promoting staff at Manchester’s Whalley Range High School. The committee normally considers cases put to it when a holder of an honour has been found guilty of a criminal offence or when they have been censured by a regulator or professional body relevant to the granting of the award. Other examples of recent forfeitures include a company boss who forfeited his CBE after being disqualified from serving as a director following a Government investigation, a doctor who lost his OBE implicated in a series of deaths at a leading hospital and a man who lose his MBE following a forgery charge. Most famously, champion jockey Lester Piggott was stripped of his OBE after serving 12 months for a £2.8 million tax fraud in 1987. The committee is thought to have discussed Sir Fred’s knighthood in 2009, but no action was taken. MPs say that following the FSA’s report into the RBS, there is now an overwhelming argument that he has been criticised by the relevant regulatory authority and should lose it. Disgraced: Tyrannical Robert Mugabe and Dame Jean Else, the 'super-head' schoolteacher who was guilty of misconduct, were stripped of their . official awards following a recommendation by the panel . Stripped: Boxer Prince Naseem Hamed had his MBE revoked for his driving conviction . The FSA said the former RBS chief . executive had aggressively expanded the institution over his eight-year . tenure – culminating in the disastrous acquisition of ABN Amro in 2007. It found RBS had been brought to its knees by ‘multiple poor decisions’ and its £50billion ‘gamble’ on buying the Dutch bank. Despite . his key role in the downfall of RBS, Paisley-born Sir Fred continues to . enjoy a gold-plated lifestyle, funded by a £342,500-a-year pension. The banker also took out a £2.8million tax-free lump sum from his pension before he started receiving it. He has not been prosecuted or penalised in any way, despite steering the bank to the brink of collapse. Tory MP Matthew Hancock, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee, and is a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, said: ‘No-one has ever presided over a bigger corporate disaster that has had implications for every single family in Britain than Fred Goodwin. ‘The knighthood given to him by Gordon Brown is inappropriate for someone who was reckless at the helm of one of Scotland’s oldest institutions.’ Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron . said: ‘It was completely inappropriate that he had it in the first . place. He is someone who has damaged the country by his actions. ‘If . it had been through incompetence, we could have lived with it. But it . was through utter recklessness which cost thousands of people their jobs . and left us to pick up the bill.’ Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry said: ‘I think honours are supposed to be for people who deserve them, and he doesn’t.’ Barrage of criticism: Fred Goodwin faced angry protesters and furious shareholders at a meeting in 2008 over the way he and his management team had got the bank into such a weak financial position . Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: . ‘Honours should be reserved for those who serve not stuff the public, so . this is a case the committee should look long and hard at.’ Liberal . Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott, who is close to Business Secretary Vince . Cable, said: ‘In the light of the FSA report, it is completely untenable . that he should be allowed to keep his knighthood. ‘We . all know the cost of his services to banking. If ever there was a case . for someone to be stripped of his knighthood, it is Sir Fred Goodwin who . ran RBS into the ground and cost every taxpayer in this country £40 . billion and counting.’ All ears: British Prime Minister David Cameron says he is 'sympathetic' for demands that the banker have his knighthood stripped of him . Jim . Sheridan, the Labour MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire North, said Sir . Fred should be stripped of his knighthood for ‘causing so much misery . and damage to industry’. “I don’t know how anyone can refer to him as ‘sir’,” he said. “The government needs to demonstrate that people who behave in this way will not be given rewards of any kind.” Independent Lothian MSP Margo MacDonald added: “The honourable thing for him to do would be to hand it back. Shadow Cabinet minister Michael Dugher said: ‘It was wrong that Fred Goodwin was knighted. Most of my constituents in Barnsley think it is outrageous he can dine out on being a ‘sir’ and I am inclined to agree with them.’ Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘Sir Fred Goodwin is utterly discredited, like the party who gave him the honour. He ruined RBS and left the nation to foot the cost. It is right and justified that he should be stripped of his knighthood. The public will welcome this.’ Liberal Democrat MP Lorely Burt, who is chair of the Liberal Democrat backbench business committee, said: ‘A knighthood is an honour bestowed on individuals who are devoted to and give up their time for the public good. If Sir Fred Goodwin is  allowed to hold on to his, it would diminish the value of these honours for all those who truly deserve them.’ Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner said: . ‘Sir Fred Goodwin should be stripped of his knighthood - and not before . time. He is representative of bankers everywhere who have abused their . positions for their own ends. I am not a fan of the honours system. It . is time the whole thing was cleaned up.’ Labour MP Teresa Pearce, a member of . the Commons Treasury select committee, said: ‘It was an error to give . him a knighthood. If Fred Goodwin was given his honour for services to . banking, I’d love to see what a disservice looked like. This man . collapsed an entire bank and nearly the British economy.’ “He has been so lacking in honour. If he wants to try to make it up to the people he let down and the communities whose standards of probity and care towards each other he stamped on, then one of the things he could do is give the knighthood back. “A knighthood is supposed to honour probity and all-round generosity of spirit to the community. I don’t think we can say that about him.” Honour: The prestigious knighthood medal . The FSA report into the collapse of RBS, published late last year, concluded that the bank’s directors – led by Sir Fred and former chairman Sir Tom McKillop – relied for their due diligence during the disastrous takeover of ABN AMRO on two ring-binder folders and a CD. The report also detailed the strained relationship between the watchdog and Sir Fred before 2005, in particular over RBS’s reluctance to allow its non-executive directors to meet the FSA on an individual one-to-one basis. ‘FSA supervisory records from 2004 suggest that RBS management, and in particular the RBS chief executive, had been resistant to what they saw as unnecessary FSA interference,’ the watchdog said. The FSA said Sir Fred pushed ahead with the reckless ABN AMRO deal without ‘a sufficient understanding of the risks involved’. The report said: ‘The decision to make a bid of this scale on the basis of a limited due diligence entailed a degree of risk-taking that can reasonably be criticised as a gamble. ‘Many will find this conclusion [that no director will face sanctions] difficult to accept. Surely someone can and should be held responsible.’ It also said that ‘Sir Fred’s ‘robust and assertive’ management style had been flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003. The banker won his knighthood in 2004. FSA chairman Lord Turner has admitted taxpayers are ‘absolutely furious’ that Sir Fred could apparently not be punished. Asked if he thought it was fair the banker had got away scot-free he said: ‘No, no I don’t.’\n",

A judge hit out yesterday after discovering that a woman who falsely claimed £94,000 in benefits will clear the debt by using her welfare payments. ‘The taxpayer just ends up paying itself back,’ stormed Beverley Lunt after being told Cleo Embley would draw on her £237-a-week handouts. The judge jailed 37-year-old Embley for 22 weeks, saying the money was not going to be repaid in any meaningful way. Anger: Cleo Embley, left, falsely claimed £43,000 in benefits - but as judge Beverley Lunt, right, pointed out, she will receive State funds to help her pay back her debt . The mother of seven had pocketed extra benefits by claiming she lived alone. But . undercover investigators spotted her handyman partner Paul Harwood . taking their children to school and returning to the home they shared. Between . 2008 and 2012, Embley illegally obtained £94,064 in income support, . housing benefit and council tax benefit. Had she told the truth about . her partner she would instead have been paid £50,955 in tax credits. This means she needs to return around £43,000. When . her lawyer Mark Stuart said his client ‘knows she is going to have to . pay the money back’, Judge Lunt interrupted to say: ‘But she isn’t – the . taxpayer is going to have to pay it back! Trapped by surveillance: Embley, 37, did not tell officials that her boyfriend was living with her when she claimed benefits . ‘She . has defrauded all this money but is entitled, from the state, to more . money! So the state will receive the money, from the money the state is . giving her!’ Embley . started making legitimate claims in 2001, but failed to inform the . benefits system when she moved in with Mr Harwood, who is father of six . of her seven children. Gerald Jones, prosecuting, said: ‘Random . surveillance showed Mr Harwood taking the children to school, returning . with the shopping – effectively living as man and wife.’ Mr . Stuart told Burnley Crown Court that jailing Embley, from Rishton, . Lancashire, would stop her partner working. ‘He would have to look after . the seven children and would have to give up his employment and be in . receipt of benefits,’ said the barrister. Sentence: The fraudster was handed a 22-week prison sentence at Burnley Crown Court, pictured . Embley . broke down in tears in the dock as Judge Lunt rejected this argument, . telling her: ‘Over a period of four years you obtained over £94,000 of . taxpayers’ money you were not entitled to.‘You were not driven by debt or financial need but greed. ‘You took away that which should be given to people who are genuinely in need. ‘These frauds are becoming a very real and common problem. ‘It . is realistically not going to be paid back – and if it is it will come . back from the taxpayer as you are getting benefits still.’ Embley admitted three counts of dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances. After . the hearing Joan Smith, deputy leader of Hyndburn Council, said: ‘We . actively pursue people for benefit fraud and we want to give the message . that you are not going to get away with it. 'We . are very good at pursuing information about benefit fraud, which we get . from various sources including members of the public.’ Lord . Freud, who is the minister for welfare reform, said: ‘We are taking on . benefit fraud, with greater resources going to our investigation teams . to stop those people who try to pocket support meant for the most . vulnerable. ‘We have also ramped up our use of powers to claw back money from these cynical criminals.’ In . 2011, Judge Lunt hit out at rules that stopped her jailing salesman . Daniel Blagboro for falsely claiming £12,000 in benefits, saying of the . resulting suspended sentence: ‘Some may think it’s pathetic, and that . includes me.’ In 2008 she refused to spare a Nigerian illegal immigrant’s bogus bride from a jail term even though she was having a baby.

      "145. By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 13:57 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:26 EST, 24 September 2013 . An Italian con man man who romanced Anne Hathaway before spending 4-1/2 years in federal prison for fraud was knee-deep in the world of Bill and Hillary Clinton before his arrest and a catastrophic downfall, a new report reveals. Raffaello Follieri, whom federal prosecutors sent to prison in 2008 for defrauding his backers, accepted a $50 million investment three years earlier from the Yucaipa Group, where Bill Clinton was the senior adviser, The New Republic reports. While the money was earmarked for buying properties from the Roman Catholic Church and converting them into commercial developments, Follieri spent much of it on himself and Hathaway. He also claimed to be the Vatican's chief financial officer at one point. Follieri's personal receipts later included $37,000 per month for an apartment complete with an executive chef and a private dog-walker, and at least one $107,000 jet rental for him and Hathaway to join the Clintons for New Year's Eve at Oscar de la Renta’s Dominican Republic estate. Happier times: Raffaello Follieri and Anne Hathaway were a pair in 2008 at the Oscars, but a few months later the fraudster was in handcuffs with a $21 million bail order . Band (R) rose from a White House internship to become the ultimate gatekeeper to Bill Clinton . Politico: Among Follieri's well-connected friends were Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain (L) and Terry McAuliffe (R), the Democrats' candidate for Virginia governor . 'In his recently published autobiography,' The Wall Street Journal reported in 2007, 'Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic Party leader who is now chairman of Sen. [Hillary] Clinton's presidential campaign, includes a group photo from a January 2006 party in the Dominican Republic resort of Punta Cana. It shows Mr. and Mrs. McAuliffe, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ms. Hathaway and Mr. Follieri.' McAuliffe is now locked in a neck-and-neck Virginia gubernatorial election battle with the state 's Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli. Doug Band, Clinton's 41-year-old former 'body man,' became super-rich from his association with the former president and now owns a trio of adjoining New York City apartments valued at $10.3 million. Band's entree to the jet set came through Follieri, whose meteoric rise into New York's financial elite was fueled, prosecutors later found, by lies. 'Follieri courted Band by playing on his taste for the high life,' according to The New Republic. The fraudster invited Band and his then-girlfriend to fancy dinners and introduced them to the rich and famous. 'Band was exposed to another universe,' former Follieri publicist Melanie Bonvicino told the magazine. 'The cosmetics of it worked for everybody.' Band, who was -- and still is -- Bill Clinton's gatekeeper, reciprocated by bringing Follieri to meet the super-wealthy in the former president's inner circle, some of whom later invested with the con man. Once firmly inside the Bill Clinton Orbit, Follieri brought Hathaway within arm's reach of the former Oval Office charmer . Bill Clinton and his longtime pal billionaire Ron Burkle (R) put $50 million into Follieri's fabricated plan to buy up church properties, based on an introduction from Clinton 'body man' Doug Band . 'With Band’s help,' according to the lengthy article, 'Follieri got meetings with, among others, Clinton himself, Burkle, and Carlos Slim, the richest man in the world, aboard Slim’s yacht in the Sea of Cortez.' 'Slim declined to invest, but another introduction paid off: Through another Clinton contact, Keith Stein, Band hooked Follieri up with Michael Cooper, the head of Toronto-based Dundee Realty Corporation, who kicked in $6 million.' Burkle, a billionaire and long-time 'Friend Of Bill,' took a meeting with Follieri in 2005 and inked a deal to buy the church properties, based on the grifter's promise that he had special access at the Vatican. One year later, Yucaipa was suing for breach of contract. When that money came in, Follieri paid $400,000 to a shell company that Band had set up to allow businesses, including Yucaipa, to supplement his income so he could afford to work for Clinton on a relatively modest $110,000 salary. With that money in hand, Band and his brother Gregory made $4,600 contributions -- the maximum allowed at the time -- to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Band told The New Republic that he eventually repaid the $400,000 payoff, sending it to Cooper directly. But that development came in 2007, after Yucaipa sued Follieri and press inquiries began to percolate. In 2006, Follieri was also wooing at least one prominent Republican at the time: Arizona Sen. John McCain. A photograph published by the liberal magazine The Nation shows Follieri greeting guests while the senator walks up the gangplank of a yacht on his 70th birthday in 2006. Follieri had rented the boat for a month to sail the Adriatic Sea. McCain was in Montenegro as part of a congressional-delegation trip. Follieri once took Hathaway for an audience with Pope John Paul II, cementing his contrived image as a Vatican insider . 'A few months after McCain's yacht party,' The Nation reported, 'Follieri strengthened his ties to McCain's orbit by retaining Rick Davis's well-connected Washington lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, and offering Davis both an investment deal and help in securing the Catholic vote for McCain's presidential bid.' Once, at an annual meeting of the then-one-year-old Clinton Global Initiative, the former president seemed to give Follieri his own public imprimatur with an on-stage embrace. The rub: As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton girds up for a 2016 presidential campaign, she can ill afford any hints of financial impropriety surrounding her famous political family . At the September 21, 2006 event, Clinton called the swindler to the stage and thanked him for a $50 million pledge, which was earmarked for vaccinating Honduran children against hepatitis A. That money never materialized. 'Why anyone would allow him to get close to Clinton and be on a stage saying he’s going to give $50 million away?' one Clinton insider told Vanity Fair two years later, speaking of Band. 'It’s absolutely nuts.' Band largely traded on his access to Clinton, The New Republic reported. In one case a company hoping for a Clinton speech at a conference approached Band for guidance. In addition to recommending a sizable donation to the Clinton Global Initiative, he also reportedly said the company should 'also pay you for having made that happen' 'Doug has always been reasonably commercial, let’s just say,' a former White House colleague said. 'He was a gatekeeper who charged tolls.' Follieri is now back in Italy, with his felony convictions for wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy behind him. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. senator who is now exploring a presidential run, did not respond to e-mailed questions about Band's role in her previous campaigns, and whether she ever benefited from Follieri's short-lived financial connections. Doug Band also has not responded to a phone message seeking comment.\n",

Benefit fraudster: Dennis Hopwood falsely claimed £43,000 in benefits he wasn't entitled to . A wealthy pensioner pocketed £43,000 in a benefit fraud after failing to declare his family owned and later sold a luxury hotel. Former paratrooper Dennis Hopwood, 75, falsely claimed Pension Credit and council tax benefits over eight years despite receiving £500 per week from the family business. His scam continued even after his wife and son sold the Bridge House Hotel they ran in Acocks Green, Birmingham, for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Hopwood appeared at Coventry Crown Court on Friday where he pleaded guilty to receiving £27,710 in Pension Credit that he wasn't entitled to between October 2003 and May 2012. He also admitted evasion of liability by . deception between October 2005 and May 2012 when he falsely . claimed £15,538 council tax benefit. The pensioner received a 10 month jail . sentence, suspended for 18 months, after a judge branded his behaviour . 'thoroughly dishonest'. The ex-soldier was told he had narrowly . avoided being sent to prison because of his early guilty plea, genuine . remorse, and repayment of the £43,248 benefits. Hopwood was also placed on a curfew for six months, from between 9pm and 8am, and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge. The court heard that his wife, Barbara, and son, Paul, were partners in the Bridge House Hotel. Hopwood and his wife lived on the premises but he did not have a share in the business, although he carried out odd jobs. Hopwood began claiming Pension Credit for himself and his wife after stating on official forms that he had no additional income and savings of £6,000. The former soldier also went on to claim council tax benefit. Yet the Department of Works and Pension eventually became aware he was receiving £500 per week from the business account of Bridge House Hotel. In total, investigators found £40,000 was transferred to his account in 80 weekly payments between August 2003 and February 2005. The scam continued even after the hotel was sold in 2005, when £203,071 was paid into the account of Hopwood's wife and son. Yet . the ex-paratrooper failed to declare the capital and he and his wife . later bought a property in Darlow Drive, Stratford-upon-Avon, and were . left with no mortgage. Spared jail: Hopwood was given a 10 month prison sentence suspended for 18 months at Coventry Crown Court . Investigators eventually caught up with the benefit cheat who, under questioning, admitted his wife was running the hotel business but he initially denied receiving £500 per week. Hopwood later confirmed he had been pocketing the weekly cash. He also claimed he had little understanding of the benefit system - but admitted his actions could be seen as being 'a little shady'. Andrew Evans, defending, said his client was of previous good character and could not be more sorry. Hopwood, who suffered a stroke in 2010, had since repaid 'every single penny', he added. 'Anyone who knows Dennis Hopwood would find it very difficult to understand what he's done,' said Mr Evans. He said he was a former paratrooper and was wearing his tie in court to give him courage. The court heard neither his wife nor his son had any idea about his benefit fraud. The lawyer said his client had failed to declare his wider financial interests, which included that he had effectively an equitable interest in the hotel. Mr Evans added the crime was not 'premeditated' and his client was not a greedy man. But Recorder Spencer Bernard told Hopwood he had committed, a 'thoroughly dishonest and persistent scheme of offending, telling Hopwood: 'You knew exactly what was going on.'\n",

It's the emotionless face of a father being shamed in front of his daughters for a despicable act. Steven C. DeMocker, 59, who was acused of horrifically bludgeoning his ex-wife to death in order to escape alimony payments and claim her $750,000 life insurance policy, has been found guilty of murder. His two daughters, Katie and Charlotte, broke down in tears as the verdict was read out in Yavapai County Courthouse in Prescott, Arizona, following a two and a half day deliberation by the jury. Virginia Carol Kennedy, an artist who was described as 'adventurous, radiant, wise, humble and accomplished', was killed at her home on the night of July 2, 2008. She had been beaten so hard her skull had shattered. Guilty: Steven DeMocker looks back at his daughters in the gallery after being convicted of first-degree murder in the bludgeoning death of his ex-wife . Steven DeMocker's daughter Katie wipes away tears as her father is convicted of the first degree murder of her mother, Virginia Carol Kennedy, in 2008. The prosecution claimed DeMocker - a former high-flying stockbroker who was left debt-ridden by the financial crash - used a golf club, specifically a 7-wood Big Bertha made by Calloway, according to The Daily Courier. While the weapon was never found, investigators recovered the club's head cover. A detailed account of what drove DeMocker to kill Kennedy was heard by the court over the course of the trial, which started in July. DeMocker was a financial advisor at UBS Financial Services who worked solely on commission. At the height of his career he was earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. But according to several experts who testified at the trial, DeMocker spent more than he made and had incurred a huge debt. When the economy crashed, DeMocker's take-home was slashed. One month he was paid nothing. His marriage to Kennedy fell apart in the process and, according to an email exchange following their separation, DeMocker was borrowing $20,000 a month from his father to pay his bills. Some of these bills were alimony payments to Kennedy, which were $6000-a-month. DeMocker soon decided he would kill Kennedy, the prosecution said. Viriginia Carol Kennedy was beaten so badly her skull was shattered. Her ex-husband Steven DeMocker has been found guilty of her murder five years after her death. DeMocker's motive was her life insurance policy. She was described by friends as 'adventurous' and 'humble' Prosecutors argued the case without having a confession, eyewitnesses or direct evidence tying DeMocker to the crime. The defense  countered that authorities didn't properly investigate Kennedy's death and tried to direct attention to a man who lived with her at the time but who has since died. DeMocker was found guilty of first-degree murder and six other counts: first-degree burglary, three counts of fraudulent schemes and artifices, evidence tampering, and a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The non-murder charges against DeMocker stemmed from allegations that he arranged to have an anonymous email sent to lawyers claiming drug gang members killed Kennedy. DeMocker also had floated a story about a voice in the vent at the Camp Verde jail after his arrest that said his ex-wife was 'killed by two guys from Phoenix'. Investigators concluded DeMocker concocted the account. DeMocker is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 13. The prosecution have not pushed for the death penalty. He could receive either life in prison or life in prison with a chance of release after 25 years on the murder charge, plus additional time  over the convictions for burglary, conspiracy, tampering with evidence, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and two counts of fraud.\n",

Silvio Berlusconi is under investigation by Italian prosecutors for allegedly paying a series of huge lump sums to a call girl in return for her silence over prostitutes attending his parties. The revelation comes as the embattled former prime minister faces being stripped of his Senate seat following his tax fraud conviction and four-year prison sentence. It's alleged that Mr Berlusconi paid German-born ex-model Sabina Began - said to be the 'Queen Bee' of his female following - 1.5 million euros (£1.26m) over a period of months for keeping quiet about sending call girls to his parties. Investigation: Italian prosecutors are trying to establish whether Silvio Berlusconi (left) rewarded Sabina Began (right) for keeping quite about prostitutes attending his parties . It's alleged that she recruited call girls for parties at Mr Berlusconi's Rome residence - Palazzo Grazioli, the Daily Telegraph reports. Ms Began, who has previously declared her love for the former prime minister and has 'S.B' tattooed on her ankle as a show of adoration for him, says that the money was a gift and she refutes hiring call girls on his behalf. The Italian press has unearthed bank records that apparently show that several payments amounting to 1.5 million euros were sent to her by Mr Berlusconi between 2011 and 2012. Prosecutors are also looking into Mr Berlusconi's dealings with businessman Gianpaolo Taratini, from southern Italy, as there are suspicions that he provided Mr Berlusconi with prostitutes and has been paid 500,000 euros in return for his silence over the matter. Prosecutors tapped a phone call between the pair in 2011 in which, The Daily Telegraph reports, Mr Berlusconi said: 'Listen Gianpaolo, we need at most two each. Then we can trade. After all, the pussy needs to go around.' The probe follows Mr Berlusconi being defeated in his attempts to bring down the Italian government after his party voted to support the coalition of premier Enrico Letta, in a major U-turn.

He booked in to Lumley Castle, where rooms start at £120 a night, on July 28 last year with his wife and four-year-old son. The father-of-three also booked another suite for an unnamed man. He had racked up a bill for £624 at the hotel - which has 73 rooms, some with four-poster beds and jacuzzi-style baths - and left without paying. On .

Carer: Sarah Biggs, 45, pleaded guilty to fraud and was jailed for 21 months at Chichester Crown Court . A carer who stole £90,000 from a dementia-suffering pensioner's bank account has been jailed for almost two years. Sarah Biggs orchestrated the sale of 85-year-old John Gallo's family home in Wallington, Surrey, before moving him 50 miles away to Worthing, West Sussex, so she could pocket the proceeds. The 45-year-old, who had cared for him since 2003, exploited her position to almost empty his bank account over three years - then left him alone and uncared for when the money ran out. She had been informed by her bosses at Sutton London Borough Council that Mr Gallo was a vulnerable elderly man who had been conned by rogue traders in the past, a court was told. In 2006, she helped him sell his large house in Wallington - where he had lived since childhood - then played a big role in his £82,000 purchase of a flat in Worthing, near where she lived. Biggs had isolated Mr Gallo from his estranged family and care services while she helped herself to £92,367 left over from the house sale, Chichester Crown Court in West Sussex heard. Her crime was only uncovered after Mr Gallo was found wandering outside in the snow in his underpants in winter 2008 and West Sussex County Council took over management of his affairs. Position of trust: Gallo (outside court on Friday), who had cared for the man since 2003, exploited her position to almost empty his bank account over a three-year period - then left him uncared for when the money ran out . Biggs, who had claimed the money was given to her by Mr Gallo, pleaded guilty to fraud and was jailed for 21 months on Friday by Judge Claudia Ackner. The judge told her: ‘This offence is a very great breach of trust by you as the carer of a very elderly and vulnerable gentleman. You knew Mr Gallo was a man of some considerable financial means. ‘As his care worker throughout that period, you knew he was vulnerable to all forms of abuse - in particular financial abuse. You were in a position of trust by Mr Gallo. ‘The basis of your plea is you entered a situation where you received huge sums of money from Mr Gallo when you were aware to do so was improper. In receiving these sums, you acted dishonestly.’ Biggs had stashed the proceeds from the sale of Mr Gallo's home in Wallington in a Nationwide bank account she had opened by forging the pensioner's signature. She then forged 11 cheques from the account to pay herself £27,000, and made cash withdrawals of £12,360 using a debit card. Sentencing: Chichester Crown Court (pictured) in West Sussex heard Biggs had isolated John Gallo from his estranged family and care services while she helped herself to £92,367 left over from the house sale . The rest of the money was received by standing orders to her own account, and large transfers funnelled through an internet savings account she had also opened in Mr Gallo's name. Jonathan Edwards, prosecuting, said Biggs ceased contact with Mr Gallo when the account was ‘practically empty’ in late 2008. 'He was losing weight. He had no mattress on his bed. He kept a sparsely furnished flat which was filthy. He had poor quality clothes and had stopped paying his bills' Jonathan Edwards, prosecuting . ‘The Crown says it could be viewed that he was simply no longer of any use to her,’ he said. ‘At that time, he was losing weight. He had no mattress on his bed. ‘He kept a sparsely furnished flat which was filthy. He had poor quality clothes and had stopped paying his bills.’ Biggs, of Worthing, had been instrumental in moving Mr Gallo to Worthing. Mr Edwards added: ‘It was said by Miss Biggs in interview that Mr Gallo wanted to move to the coast to be nearer to his sister. There had not been contact between Mr Gallo and his sister for 20 years. ‘With that in mind, Miss Biggs telephoned Mr Gallo's sister but it seems she did not facilitate in a reunion of Mr Gallo and his sister. Miss Biggs told Mr Gallo that his sister did not want contact with him. ‘That seems to be untrue. The move to . Worthing had the effect of isolating Mr Gallo and making him vulnerable . to exploitation by Miss Biggs.’ Change: Biggs orchestrated the sale of John Gallo's family home in Wallington (file picture, left), Surrey, before moving him 50 miles away to Worthing (file picture, right), West Sussex, so she could pocket the proceeds . Simon Gruchy, defending, said Biggs could repay the money in full. He added: ‘She should not have taken those sums and she had accepted it was dishonest and that is where her criminality lies. ‘She has lost her good name, she's lost her job - a job she was good at and did for over 20 years. This was a relationship which developed in a way that was completely out of character as far as this lady was concerned.’ 'To be treated like this by someone who claimed to be caring for him was simply appalling and the team that worked with him and his family have found this quite traumatic' Amanda Rogers, West Sussex County Council . Judge Ackner said Biggs could be out of jail within ten and a half months. After the sentencing, West Sussex County Council's director of adults' services Amanda Rogers said: ‘This was a shocking case. ‘To be treated like this by someone who claimed to be caring for him was simply appalling and the team that worked with him and his family have found this quite traumatic. ‘This is a vulnerable elderly gentleman, who has long term mental health problems and dementia. ‘He was let down and manipulated by the person who claimed to be caring for him. She cut him off from his family, she took all his money and didn't ensure he was safe. ‘He wasn't managing his food or fluids and didn't have a bed in his flat. In terms of the scale of the financial abuse and the level of manipulation and pre-meditation, this is one of the worst cases we've seen. ‘We are glad to have secured this outcome and to have got him back in regular contact with his family.’\n",

Shamed: Alan Crickmore (pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court today) was suspended from practising as a solicitor in December 2010 . One of Britain’s longest serving coroners was today facing jail after he admitted plundering £2million from the estates of the dead. Alan Crickmore, 57, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, stole the money in a 'frenzied attempt' to balance the books at his law firm. He was first arrested in January 2011 after a probe into irregularities at his practice by police, who had only found out about the allegations following a report in a local newspaper. The former Gloucestershire coroner admitted 16 counts of theft, seven of . fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud between 1999 and 2011 at . Southwark Crown Court in London. After a career spanning 30 years, he was suspended from practising as a solicitor in December 2010, and shortly afterwards ceased acting in his role as coroner of Gloucestershire. Since his suspension he is still being paid a £60,000-a-year salary by his firm, it emerged. Crickmore became Gloucester deputy coroner in 1990, took over as the city coroner in 2002, and three years later was coroner for the Cotswolds. He then combined the two jobs to become the first coroner to cover all of Gloucestershire. He also deceived trustees who were clueless about financial matters, the court heard today. He embarked on an ‘absolutely chronic’ campaign of deceit from 1999 to 2011. Crickmore even took out a bogus mortgage on a property in Stiffkey, Norfolk, after he was ordered to repay £212,000 he stole from trustee Judith Lorman following a high court judgement. Dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and purple tie, Crickmore appeared to be close to tears as he admitted 16 counts of theft, seven counts of fraud by abuse of position and a further count of fraud. Hearing: Crickmore admitted 16 counts of theft, seven of fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud between 1999 and 2011 at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) in Central London . Mark Fenhalls, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr Crickmore is a 57-year-old man who qualified as a solicitor in the 1980s and has been in practice in Gloucester since 1992. ‘He stole in various different ways about £2million from clients. All of the money was stolen from clients either from their estates if they died or clients who were unable to understand.’ Crickmore plundered the estates of the late Kenneth Layton Goodwin, Josef Dziuma, Elizabeth Iles and Peter Mitchell. He also conned Mrs Lorman and her son, Simon, as well as Claire Wilson and Sylvia Jones. Edward Henry, defending Crickmore, said he had been ‘in a trap of his own making for years’, resulting in a significant effect on his mental and physical health. ‘He became a fraud to himself before he became a conman, I regret to submit, to his clients. ‘He embarked on a frenzied attempt to balance the books and this was absolutely chronic over a period of over a decade. He has a significant history of depression and is completely broken by this. ‘He was made bankrupt in 2011 and discharged from bankruptcy in 2012 only because all of his assets were restrained for the purposes of confiscation. He comes before the court abjectly devoid of funds.’ 'He became a fraud to himself before he became a conman. He has a significant history of depression and is completely broken by this' Edward Henry, defending . Adjourning sentence for reports, Judge Anthony Leonard QC told Crickmore: ‘You have pleaded guilty to serious offences and you know what the inevitable result of that will be. ‘There is only one potential outcome, that is a sentence of imprisonment.’ Crickmore, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was bailed and electronically tagged ahead of a sentencing hearing on November 28. He denied a further count of fraud by abuse of position which was left on the court file. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Sellwood of Gloucestershire Constabulary said: ‘This has been a meticulous and thorough two year investigation by Gloucestershire Constabulary that followed an investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. ‘We are pleased that now, having been faced with overwhelming evidence, Mr Crickmore has acknowledged his guilt to 24 of the 25 charges put to him. We will now await sentencing on Thursday 28th November.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.\n",

At least five brides were clad in the same distinctive red and yellow shawl, while a golden turban appears to have been passed between the grooms. The officials had struck gold – exposing a major sham marriage scam. Suspicious: Eva Holubova's wedding with Nikola Horvarthova (right).

A string of Eastern European and British brides were paid up to £1,000 to fly to Pakistan and pose for wedding pictures, with the aim of getting dozens of Pakistani men into Britain illegally. With proof of their marriage, each man could apply to come to Britain to be with his wife, who was here legally as a result of EU open border rules. The scam organisers thought that by holding the wedding ceremonies in Pakistan they would evade the scrutiny of register offices in the UK, where officials are on the look-out for bogus couples. But clearly they needed to pay more attention to the details. Same clothes: The traditional dress was the same in Sabah Qureshi wore as she smiled with her new 'husband' Not only were the garments the same, several of the weddings appear to have taken place in the same room, with the same broken clock on the wall. Tinsel and other decorations also appeared in several pictures. Standing alongside Czech bride Eva Holubova, 20, in one of her weddings is 26-year-old Nikola Horvarthova, apparently acting as her maid of honour. She also joined in the scam, staging her own wedding wearing the same outfit – and in the same room. A court heard that Holubova was paid to get married three times in four months. Three other fake brides, Czechs Michaela Lengyelova, 30, Matylda Krejci, 29, and Briton Sabah Qureshi, 24, also wore the red and yellow diamond-pattern shawl for their photos. All were handed jail sentences of up to a year for immigration fraud at Sheffield Crown Court. Jailing Holubova and Horvarthova, Judge Rosalind Coe said it was a ‘very well organised and professional operation’. She told the gang members: ‘Participation in sham marriages is an abuse of the marriage ceremony itself and an abuse of immigration control. Sham marriages strike at the heart of our immigration system.’ In total 16 brides were prosecuted by Home Office officials in several cases over the last year involving the highly organised sham marriage gang based in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Investigation: A court heard fake bride Nikola Horvarthova (pictured) was one of the women that took part. A string of Eastern European and British brides were paid up to £1,000 to fly to the Pakistani capital Islamabad and pose for wedding pictures . Ringleader Talib Hussain, 42, was jailed for six years in January. His house was described in court as the engine room of the conspiracy. His ex-wife Rahina Zaman, 33, who helped him, was jailed for two-and-a-half years. Two of the other main organisers, Tariq Mehmood, 27, and Veronika Horvothova, 21, are still on the run. Mark Bates, from the Home Office’s Immigration Enforcement Criminal and Financial Investigation team, said: ‘This has been a complex case, with our investigations stretching from the UK to Pakistan. The gang involved thought they had come up with an ingenious way of breaching UK immigration laws. They were wrong, and as a result are now behind bars. ‘The message to anyone involved in this sort of criminality is clear. The Home Office has dedicated teams with the resource and expertise to catch up with you and bring you to justice.’ Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘The sentences handed out send a clear message to anyone tempted to break immigration rules. We have the resources, expertise and technology to catch you, and you will pay with your liberty.’\n",

Jailed: Jonathan Revill, 38, defrauded his employers of £19million over the course of three years . An IT manager who defrauded his employers out of £19million to fuel his gambling addiction has been jailed for seven years. Jonathan Revill, 38, exploited his position at a multinational energy company to order computer equipment which he then sold for a fraction of its worth, using the proceeds to bet online. He gambled as much as £300,000 on a single sporting fixture and even blew £20,000 in one night after he had been arrested over the deception. During a three-year period he made £5.6million from selling the equipment, but all he had to show for it was a £500,000  family home in West Yorkshire. His wife did not learn of his criminal behaviour – or his secret gambling addiction – until he was caught and she was told they would lose their home. Revill, a father of one, pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to four offences of fraud and three of transferring criminal property – selling goods obtained by crime. He was employed as a service delivery systems manager at a Leeds-based subsidiary company of GDF Suez – one of the world’s biggest energy companies with a billion-pound turnover. Mehran Nassiri, prosecuting, said Revill was earning a £55,000 a year with a £400-a-month car allowance but had a ‘serious addiction to gambling’. Less than a year after he started working for the firm he realised he could place orders that would not be noticed. Although he was limited to £3,000 purchases without further approval, he forged signatures and over the next three years ordered equipment worth £18,976,000. It was delivered either to his home in Huddersfield or to a storage unit, Revill then either auctioned it on eBay or sold it for a fraction of its value to one of six companies. Home: Revill used the proceeds of his fraud to buy this £500,000 family house in Huddersfield . Addiction: Revill once spent £300,000 in a single session of gambling on websites such as Bet365 . His deception came to light in May . when an audit at GDF Suez revealed financial irregularities – but by . then he had gambled away nearly all of the £5.6million he raised from . selling the goods. Jailing . him for seven years, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: ‘This was a vast . amount of money.’ He warned Revill that his wife and daughter would now . have to look for somewhere else to live. After his arrest, Revill was granted bail on condition that he stopped gambling and sought immediate help for his addiction. However, on June 2 he accessed more than £20,000 in an Isle of Man-based account and gambled it in a single evening. Benjamin . Hargreaves, mitigating, said Revill had placed a bet for £11,200 on a . Roger Federer tennis match and £13,000 on a football match during the . betting spree. He added: ‘Winning or losing didn’t matter.’ Big game: After his arrest, the IT manager gambled thousands on the result of a football match between England and Brazil, pictured . Loss: Revill wasted £11,250 betting against Roger Federer, pictured, on the same day . Mr . Hargreaves said Revill had tried to win big to pay back the company and . at one time had £3million in his account ‘trying to get myself out of . the hole I’d dug’ – but that had gone. Revill was relieved to be finally caught and was shocked at the total involved, he said. ‘He . accepts over the last ten years a gambling problem has got bigger and . bigger. The problem is his own and he should have sought help and by his . lies and trying to hide it he brought himself to this.’ Detective . Chief Inspector Mark  Griffin, who heads the Leeds District Proceeds of . Crime Act Team, said: ‘Revill abused his position of trust. ‘His . actions have destroyed his life and affected a number of businesses. This case clearly highlights the very serious consequences of gambling . addiction.’ The court heard . that Revill had built up debts during four months of unemployment . before starting his job at GDF Suez in April 2009. He had also been made bankrupt in 2005, but had not told his wife. Prison: The former IT manager was sentenced to seven years in jail at Leeds Crown Court, pictured .\n",

A health care assistant and her lesbian partner have been jailed for fleecing three quarters of a million pounds from a wealthy elderly recluse. Celia Brinkley, 45, was sentenced to seven years in prison after stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from 80-year-old Anthony Hornett while she was his home carer. Her partner Kerry Davies, 40, a qualified nurse, was also sentenced to 27 months in prison after admitting taking more than £80,000 of that sum from Anthony Hornett. St Albans Crown Court heard how the pair blew the pensioner's money on new cars, expensive trips and designer handbags  and told colleagues at St Albans City . Hospital that they'd won £250,000 on the lottery when questioned the pair on their luxury lifestyle. Judge Andrew Bright QC told the pair it . was difficult to imagine a greater or deeper breach of trust inflicted . on an elderly, vulnerable man. Behind bars: Health Care Assistant Celia Brinkley, 40, pictured left, and her lesbian partner, qualified nurse Kerry Davies, 40, pictured right, have both been jailed for fleecing vulnerable 80-year-old Anthony Hornett out of hundreds of thousands of pounds while they were his carers . Prosecutor Laura Blackband said the couple first met Mr Hornett in 2009 when he was in his late 70s. 'Mr . Hornett was very vulnerable and lonely. He had lived alone for many . years. He had never married and had no children. He was not visited by . relatives and was a recluse in reality,' she said. The court heard how the pair left their full-time jobs after Mr Hornett agreed to pay them £2,000 each a month to be his carers in August 2010. Brinkley would visit him twice a day and Davies just once a week. He owned three properties in St Albans and agreed to rent them one in Central Drive, which had been neglected, at a reduced price. Ms Blackband said: 'They agreed they would clean it. He would provide the white goods and would pay the council tax. The rent was £500 per month. The market rental would be £1,000. They had a very good deal.' They took over the property in June 2009 and moved in that September after cleaning it. But over the next few months, the court was told how they began fleecing money from Mr Hornett. Brinkley had access to his cheque book and forged eight cheques. She also used his Barclaycard. By June the following year, Brinkley had received £127,000 in cheques and Davies £40,000. The court heard £30,000 was spent on a VW Toureg for Brinkley and she also obtained a Mercedes convertible for £43,000 as well as a scooter. One text message Brinkley sent to Davies read: 'Sorry babe he will only give you £5,000 for your birthday.' Davies replied: 'I think that will do babe.' In fact Mr Hornett wrote a cheque for £7,000. The court heard the couple also believed they'd managed to dupe Mr . Hornett into changing his Will so they would inherit the house they were renting. Ms Blackband Mr Hornett had been plied . with drink and was persuaded by Brinkley to write a letter to his . solicitor changing his Will to leave them the house in Central Drive. In court: Sentencing at St Albans Crown Court, Judge Andrew Bright QC told the pair it . was difficult to imagine a greater or deeper breach of trust inflicted . on an elderly, vulnerable man . The elderly man’s solicitor contacted him because she was suspicious about the proposed change to his Will. It was not changed but Mr Hornett allowed the two women to continue to think they were his beneficiaries. As a result they planned £200,000 worth of extensions to the house in Central Drive. This was paid for by £300,000 they had amassed from their victim in a joint account. But the pair were caught when a policeman visiting Mr Hornett became suspicious about the building work. He also saw the two expensive cars. As a result the police obtained a Production Order from the court to look into the couple’s financial affairs and they were arrested. Inquiries were carried out and the total loss for Mr Hornett was put at £733,563.46. 'It was a staggering figure,' said Ms Blackband. In an interview with the police, Mr Hornett said he had become frightened of Brinkley, who the prosecutor said was 'the prime mover' in the fraud. On one occasion he said she became aggressive when he questioned the cost of a £10,000 boiler that she said needed installing in her home. He said it had been easier to give in to them. Brinkley, from Dellfield, St Albans, admitted two charges of fraud, nine of forgery and one of converting criminal property. Davies, also from Dellfied, St Albans, admitted one charge of converting criminal property. Terence Woods, defending Brinkley, said she had been in a relationship with Davies and they had been looking to move out of hospital accommodation. He said Brinkley and Davies were the only two people in the world who had cared for Mr Hornett who was an eccentric individual. Gideon Cammerman, representing Davies, said she had studied for a nursing degree at Sheffield University and had been an excellent nurse. 'She knows the Nursing and Midwifery Council will ensure she never works as a nurse again,' he told the court before adding that the relationship between the couple had come to an end. Judge Bright said: 'It is difficult to imagine a greater or deeper breach of trust inflicted on an elderly, vulnerable man. They were nursing staff in St Albans hospital - a job they gave up to live off the proceeds of crime.' He told Brinkley: 'You targeted him relentlessly, mercilessly and in a truly wicked way in a gross breach of trust over a considerable period.' He said she had 'milked him for every penny' she could. In sentencing Davies he said she had allowed Brinkley to do her 'dirty work' for her. A confiscation hearing will take place in January next year.\n",

San Diego Chargers outside linebacker Dwight Freeney had millions of dollars stolen by Micheal Stern, from Miami, who pretended to be an investor interested in the star's Hollywood restaurant . A former property developer who stole $3million (£1.8million) from NFL player Dwight Freeney has been jailed for five years. Michael A Stern, 53, from Miami, used the money to pay for family vacations, jewellery, his children's private school tuition and legal bills from a bankruptcy case in Florida, according to court documents. Stern claimed to be a wealthy businessman interested in investing in a Hollywood restaurant that Freeney owned in order to gain his trust. The two were introduced in February 2010 through Stern's lover Eva Weinberg, who was also Freeney's business manager. Stern then used information given to him by Weinberg to take millions of dollars from Freeney's accounts over more than a year. Sensing that the FBI were about to arrest him, Freeney called somebody who turned out to be an informant and asked them to destroy a hard drive containing evidence in March 2012. Police arrested him at Miami International Airport later the same month. Stern pleaded guilty to fraud in January and was yesterday sentenced to five years in federal prison and ordered to pay Freeney $2.6million. Weinberg pleaded guilty in June to a related count of accessory after the fact. She is set to be sentenced in December. Freeney, a seven-time Pro Bowl pass rusher, is out for the season after having surgery. Freeney's business partner, Eva Weinberg, who was also Stern's lover, gave Stern information he used to defraud the NFL player . The news comes just one day after a parking attendant was charged with stealing $225,000 from Philadelphia Eagles offensive lineman Todd Herremans. Robert Von Ryan, 37, of Philadelphia is alleged to have stolen Herremans bank details from his car while watching watching over players’ cars at the team hotel while they played at Lincoln Financial Field.

Controversial: Richard Branson's firm paid police overtime bill for probe into a fraud costing Virgin Media £144 million a year . Scotland Yard was accused of hiring . out officers for cash yesterday after Richard Branson’s business empire . paid for police investigating a massive fraud. The cable television company Virgin . Media agreed to fund the Metropolitan force’s overtime bill in an . investigation into a set-box racket costing £144million a year. The firm paid police £5,060 following . raids which revealed how thousands of viewers were using the boxes to . view subscription channels without paying. Virgin Media also agreed to give the . Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) a quarter of any compensation . awarded following a successful prosecution. One of the gang jailed over the . set-box scam has launched an appeal, alleging that police were . interested in the case only because of the money a conviction might . bring in. The extraordinary deal, at a time of . unprecedented police budget cuts, has raised wider questions about . whether the force’s impartiality is compromised in the face of so-called . incentives. The agreement between Virgin Media . and the MPA was signed in November 2008 but did not come to light until . after the conviction of three men for their part in the fraud, which . involved 400,000 dodgy set-top boxes. In August 2008, Virgin Media was . tipped off that a company named Rayyonics was manufacturing and . importing the devices, sold to suppliers and dealers across the UK. In September Virgin Media alerted . police who launched an inquiry, deploying 30 officers who worked . alongside 18 Virgin investigators. On November 19, police raids in and . around east London led to five arrests and the seizure of 5,000 set-top . boxes and £90,000 in cash. Virgin Media agreed to give the Metropolitan Police Authority a 'cash donation' of 25 per cent of any compensation awarded following a successful prosecution of the fraud . Six days later, a contract was signed . between a senior Virgin employee and the Met’s commercial partnership . manager agreeing that Virgin Media would fund the officers’ overtime . bill as they continued to pursue the inquiry. It also stated that: ‘It is agreed . that subject to the following conditions the MPA accepts from the donor . the unconditional offer of cash donations of 25 per cent of any money . returned to Virgin Media under a compensation order following asset . recovery work.’ Raids: Police arrested five people following raids in east London which resulted in 5,000 set-top boxes and £90,000 in cash being seized . In April last year, the ringleader, . Munaf Ahmed Zinga, along with Mukandun Pillai, went on trial at . Snaresbook Crown Court after attempts to argue that the police payments . were illegal were dismissed. Judge Inigo Bing ruled the contract . including the ‘incentivisation scheme’ was above board and he accepted . that the financial arrangement had been made after the arrests. Zinga, 40, was jailed for eight years . and Pillai, 39, six years for conspiracy to defraud. A third man was . jailed for 12 months after admitting being their delivery driver. Two other men were cleared. Zinga is appealing against his conviction, arguing that the payments were illegal. Challenge: One of those prosecuted after the investigation is appealing his conviction handed down at Snaresbrook Crown Court . Under the 1996 Police Act, a force may provide ‘special police services’ to ‘any person’ subject to payment. Although the Virgin deal comes under . those terms, an MPA member has questioned payments to police by a victim . in an active investigation. Jenny Jones, a member of the . authority for 12 years until it was replaced this month by the Mayor’s . Office for Policing and Crime, said: ‘I have never heard of this. It’s . like private policing and I am really shocked that somebody thought this . was OK.’ The Metropolitan Police said it could not comment pending Zinga’s legal action. Virgin Media refused to say how often it had put such contracts in place but said they were used only when appropriate. It is understood that the company has not yet applied for any compensation in relation to the fraud.\n",

The lover of a serial con artist who posed as a 'well-heeled' stockbroker has apologised to his latest victim after being jailed for helping him pull of the scam. Gail Heyworth, 51, lived a life of luxury thanks to the lies of Scott Travis despite claiming she was also one of his victims. However, she was found to be the person collecting cash from one of his victims when another woman came forward after being duped out of nearly £12,000 by Travis. Con artists: Scott Travis, left, and Gail Heyworth, right, plotted to fool a Muslim woman looking for love into handing over almost £12,000 in cash . Sorry: Heyworth, pictured here before her sentencing, met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money . The 45-year-old fraudster, who lived . with Heyworth in a council flat in Heywood, Rochdale, posed as a . 'well-heeled bachelor' on SingleMuslim.com called Mohammed Kashif Rai who was looking for a bride. He met a 25-year-old woman online and reeled her in with lies about extensive financial interests and property portfolio before concocting a sob story to ask for cash. Heyworth then met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money. Now she has joined Travis behind bars after a judge said she must have known what the 'pathological liar' was really like. Form: The court heard how conman Scott Travis has a history of fraudulent activity . Travis is already serving eight years in jail after posing as an Italian aristocrat to dupe an 82-year-old man out of £100,000. Outside court before she was jailed, Heyworth . said: 'I would just like to apologise to her. If I get any money in the . future, I would give her some. I hope he would do the same. He tells me . his family has money and, if that's the case, he should give her some.' She . claimed Travis, who lived with her in their council flat for 18 years, was . 'manipulative' and she no longer wanted him in her life. But it is the . third time she has made the claim after being involved in his string of . scams. In 2004, Heyworth . claimed she was left £15,000 in debt by unemployed Travis, after telling . her he was an Italian viscount called Franco Dibella III. She . later claimed he had wormed his way back into her life and, when Travis . was jailed last year for fleecing the elderly man, she claimed she felt . ‘sickened'. Manchester's . Minshull Street Crown Court heard she helped her lover commit his . latest lonely-hearts fraud between July and November 2011. The pair, of . Middleton, near Rochdale, both pleaded guilty to one count of fraud. Lisa . Boocock, prosecuting, said Travis told the lonely-hearts victim he was . called Mohammed Kashif Rai when he met her on the Muslim Singles . website. Fraud: Travis posed as a 'well-heeled bachelor' on the Single Muslim dating website to reel in his victim . Reality: Scott Ravis and Gail Heyworth were actually living together in this council flat in Heywood, Rochdale . He claimed he owned . property in Hale Barns and Pakistan, but later claimed he had become . the victim of fraudsters and needed money to pay for car insurance and . religious clothing. Travis . asked the victim to drop off some of the cash at his council flat, but . claimed he could not be there because he was suffering from cancer. He also arranged for the victim to hand money to Heyworth at two meetings at the Trafford Centre and in Cheetham Hill. Apology: Gail Heyworth helped Travis dupe a Muslim . woman out of nearly £12,000 . Other money was deposited in a bank account before the victim became suspicious and contacted the police. Miss Boocock said: 'The victim felt that they would marry. Everything he said was very convincing.' The victim said in a statement read out in court: 'He has betrayed me and broken my heart. He's ruined my confidence.' Travis did not appear in the dock. He had refused to leave his cell at the jail in Wolverhampton, where he is being held. Patrick . Buckley, defending Travis, said he had refused to engage with his . solicitors. Shirlie Duckworth, defending Heyworth, said the extent to . which she was taken in by him was ‘very hard to quantify'. The . court heard a psychiatric report on Heyworth found no evidence of . mental illness, but she had previously suffered from stress. Judge . Mushtaq Khokhar jailed Heyworth for eight months. He also jailed Travis . for 18 months, which will be added on to the eight-year sentence he is . already serving. He said the victim was a vulnerable woman who had been . humiliated. He said: 'He is a pathologically-born liar in every sense of the word. Even when he was caught, he persisted in that.' Sentencing . Heyworth, he added: 'It may be that he told her lies, but she lived . with him a number of years and she would have known what he was like. 'There is no way of her being manipulated like she says. She accepts that she knew this money was being obtained.'\n",

Jailed: Steven Hughes, 50, was jailed for three years after blackmailing his employee into paying £30,000 . An innocent man was forced to pay £30,000 to his boss who threatened to derail his marriage by exposing a fake affair. The victim had been awarded £40,000 in damages from his previous employers after he was fired over false claims he made inappropriate advances towards a woman. Suffering marriage problems after having a stroke, the unnamed man eventually found casual work in a furniture business with close friend Steven Hughes. But when he told Hughes about the ordeal, his new boss devised a series of scams to steal the money - including a bizarre 'kiss and tell' threat. Father-of-three Hughes, 50, recruited a friend to pose as the victim's former colleague and told her to demand £10,000 - or she would expose their 'liaison'. In a hand-written contract that he was forced to sign, the woman made false claims the victim had groped her breasts. The man was said to have felt 'backed into a corner' and agreed to pay the cash. Today, Hughes, who has not repaid the victim, was jailed for three years after he admitted fraud and blackmail at Manchester's Minshull Crown Court. The court heard how the victim, from the Greenfield area of Oldham, confided in Hughes about asking a former colleague to go for a drink in what was described as 'inappropriate circumstances'. He then told him about a 'settlement fee' of £40,000 he received from his former employer. In September 2011, the victim was called by a woman who claimed to be the same woman he was accused of inappropriately approaching through work. She demanded £10,000 from him and threatened to 'tell her story' to a newspaper and make false accusations of sexual assault if he failed to pay. The distressed victim told Hughes about the threat - but the boss falsely said his business had also received a phone call from the same woman. Hughes falsely told the victim that his solicitor had advised him that the allegations could be so damaging that the furniture company would be shut down. The victim felt backed into a corner so agreed to pay the money. Kiss and tell: Hughes offered to take the victim's money and give it to 'the woman'. He returned with this receipt . Hughes then told the man he would take the money to the woman, and returned with a handwritten statement to confirm she had received the payment. It read: 'This payment is for harassment and sexual advances. Touching my breasts, We will have no contact with anyone or speak to anyone about this matter. This is the end of the matter.' In early 2012 year, the victim gave £13,000 to Hughes, who told him about an investment where specialist furniture could be bought from Malaysia and sold for 'handsome profit' in the UK. When he was then told by Hughes that a return on the furniture investment had been 'delayed', the victim became suspicious and contacted the police in May 2012. It emerged he had also paid Hughes a further £2,000 after he falsely claimed he could get a quick sale for his house through a property firm. In court Hughes claimed he was 'deeply remorseful.' But Judge Maurice Green told Hughes: 'These were extremely serious and particularly mean offences.' After the case, PC Rebecca Gross of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The victim considered Steven Hughes to be a friend, but now we know that he was manipulating this man for financial gain. 'Over a period of time, Hughes took complete advantage of the trust that had been placed in him, seizing on the victim’s vulnerabilities. 'These vulnerabilities included a sense of distress and embarrassment at the way in which he left his job, and that became the fuel for this man to become a victim of blackmail. 'Hughes has now been put behind bars for his dishonesty and I hope that this gives the victim some closure so he can take steps to rebuild his life.'\n",

Jailed: Bodyguard Christopher Cooknell, 54, made threats to kill his boss and his family in order to secure a pay rise . A private security guard deliberately set out to make the family that employed him fear for their lives in a desperately cruel bid to win a pay rise and promotion. Christopher Cooknell, 54, sent an anonymous letter and a number of text messages to victim Daniel Holloway, threatening to kill him and his family. The sick threats terrified the family, who as a result promoted Cooknell and increased his salary. On Tuesday at Basildon Crown Court judge David Owen-Jones sentenced Cooknell to three years in jail after he had admitted at a previeous hearing to fraud and making threats to kill. After sentencing, Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Lucy Robinson, said: ‘Christopher Cooknell is a dangerous man in that he fails to fully comprehend the implications of his actions. ‘He has caused a great deal of suffering to the victim and his family by sending distressing text messages, and his actions have also resulted in two innocent men being arrested for no reason. ‘His motivation appears to be entirely for selfish financial gain and I have no doubt that had his text messages been allowed to continue he would have become increasingly greedy and sought to demand money from Mr Holloway. ‘Thankfully it never came to this, but I hope his sentence today reflects the seriousness of his actions.’ Cooknell, from Ryde on the Isle of Wight, was part of a security team first employed to help protect Mr Holloway’s family following an aggravated burglary at their family estate in Brentwood, Essex, in June 2009. In August 2011, Cooknell sent an anonymous letter threatening a further burglary, at gunpoint, at the home. The letter also resulted in the arrest of two innocent gardeners who he had falsely implicated in the original break-in. Cooknell has since admitted his part in sending the letter, which he had hoped would result in the gardeners being sacked. No evidence was found linking the gardeners to the burglary. Cooknell then went onto to send anonymous death threats in December last year 2012 from a mobile phone that police later traced back to him. Shameless Cooknell claimed the messages had simply been a ‘prank’ but later admitted making threats to kill and fraud. Verdict: Cooknell was sentenced to three years in jail at Basildon Crown Court (pictured)\n",

A financial adviser who attacked and killed a millionaire socialite after defrauding him of £343,000 to fund a lavish lifestyle has been found guilty of murder. David Jeffs, 36, splashed out on Lotus sports cars, dined at fine restaurants and stayed at top hotels using his client Roberto Troyan's money. He also frittered away his client's wealth on holidays to Mauritius, Ibiza and the USA, and blew £19,500 on his stag party at the Spearmint Rhino strip club. Murderer: David Jeffs, left, swindled his client Roberto Troyan, right, out of £343,000 and then killed him . When Mr Troyan, 63, realised hi deception and threatened to 'end his gravy train' Jeffs battered him to death at his Mayfair apartment. Jeffs had just £5.77 left in his bank account and owed the taxman £200,000 at the time of the killing. He was convicted today of murder and fraud by abuse of position by a jury of three men and nine women at Croydon Crown Court. Jeff's wife Sherry Woodward bowed her head and sobbed while Jeffs, dressed in a dark suit with a striped shirt and black tie, showed no trace of emotion. Jeffs, the son of an ambulance driver, began working for Mr Troyan in 2005. He was taken on shortly after the death of the wealthy man's 52-year-old civil partner Anthony Feldman, who was an architect and interior designer. Mr Feldman's clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken. Scene: Roberto Troyan was found dead in his property in this mansion block in Mayfair by a cleaner earlier this year . The architect's inheritance had made the victim very wealthy and Jeffs took advantage of his 'frail and vulnerable' client. Prosecutor Ed Brown told the court that 'As a result he was able to live the high life but all at the expense of the deceased who - when the defendant first met him - was a rich man.' 'He died less rich by hundreds of thousands of pounds thanks to this defendant's dishonesty. 'When the life to which the defendant happily had become accustomed to appeared to suddenly to come to an end, and that there was a real possibility that his callous acts would soon be found out, he killed him'. Jeffs blew thousands of pounds every month on polo matches, sports cars, and electric guitars. He spent £15,000 in August 2012 alone on his wedding to teacher Sherry Woodward and on their honeymoon tour of Ibiza, Malta, and Las Vegas. Jeffs had also been earning £53,000 per year with the Surrey-based firm HFM Columbus, and enjoyed an annual expense account of £8,000. 'Victim': Mr Troyan who had employed David Jeffs as his financial advisor since 2005 . Shortly before the killing Jeffs used the victim's money to pay a trip to Center Parcs for him, his son and his wife. Jeffs claimed that Mr Troyan paid him £1,000 a week - with two years' money in advance - while employed as his 'financial concierge'. But the reality was Jeffs' bad advice had left Mr Troyan struggling following the Icelandic banking crisis in 2008. He had advised his client to plough £1.2million in insurance bonds that were then invested into a subsidiary of Kaupthing, Iceland's largest bank, which went bust in October 2008. The victim, who was one of the first gay men to enter a civil partnership in Britain, was complaining bitterly about Jeffs and may have confronted him about his huge losses before he died. He was found lying dead in a pool of blood by his maid in the kitchen of his Mayfair flat on March 8. Mr Troyan had suffered multiple skull fractures, a fractured jaw, cheek and eye-socket and had inhaled blood into his airways. Murder charge: David Jeffs, 36, battered Roberto Troyan to death in his Mayfair home when his fraud was about to be uncovered, a court heard . Jeffs was seen on CCTV entering Mr . Troyan’s Mount Street apartment on the afternoon of March 8 and leaving . some 15 minutes later. He then left voicemail messages on Mr Troyan’s phone, claiming he was trying to reach him, in a bid to cover his footsteps. After murdering Mr Troyan, Jeffs travelled to Guildford, Surrey where he bought black bin-bags, wet wipes and a new set of clothes like the ones he was wearing in Mayfair. He then spent 45 minutes at a service station where he changed in a Starbucks toilet before disposing of his blood-stained garments. When Jeffs was first interviewed by police, days after the murder, he denied entering Mr Troyan's home and claimed he had only knocked on the front door but got no answer. After scientists found Mr Troyan's blood on Jeffs's briefcase, he changed his story and told police he was confronted by a mystery man who was covered in blood. He claimed he had not previously mentioned the man to avoid association with the 'messiness' of Mr Troyan's life and the scrutiny of the Inland Revenue. 'That Robert had paid me, over the course of three years, such a large amount of money and knowing that I had paid not a single penny in tax, it weighed heavily on my mind,' Jeffs said. 'In my mind the man might have been an angry pimp in some sort of bondage session, or into drugs, things like that. 'There was certainly drug-taking and possible activity with rent-boys who had been up to Robert's flat previously. 'There were times when I saw him passed out naked on the floor and debit cards covered in what looked like cocaine'. He said there were often random men present and evidence of drug-fuelled sex parties when he arrived for meetings. 'I saw a lot of evidence of cocaine-taking and sometimes there would be men I did not know there. 'Leather paddles and pornography was poorly hidden in a wicker basket and I once found Robert completely naked, passed out in his lounge surrounded by sexual paraphernalia.' Exclusive neighbourhood: Police launched a murder investigation in Mayfair after Mr Troyan was discovered dead. He had been bludgeoned to death . Jeffs, from Nottingham, denied murder and fraud by abuse of position. He will now be sentenced on 10 December at Southwark Crown Court. After the conviction, Baljit Ubhey, CPS London Chief Crown Prosecutor, said: 'This was a case of cold and calculated deception which resulted in the violent murder of Roberto Troyan by David Jeffs. 'As Mr Troyan's financial adviser, David Jeffs was able to gain his trust but then quickly began to abuse that relationship to fund his own extravagant and excessive lifestyle. 'Jeffs exploited Mr Troyan's lack of financial knowledge to steal £343,000 which he spent on sports cars, luxury hotels, exotic holidays and hospitality tickets to sporting events. 'When he realised his dishonesty was about to be exposed Jeffs murdered Mr Troyan and created an elaborate web of lies to account for his spending and to cover-up the murder. 'Today he has been brought to justice for his crimes and we hope his conviction will bring some comfort to Mr Troyan's family. Our thoughts are with them at this time.'\n",

Poised: George Osborne is set to approve a £1billion increase in foreign aid to meet the Government's controversial spending target . George Osborne is poised to approve a £1billion increase in foreign aid to meet the Government’s controversial spending target. The Chancellor has cheered Tory backbenchers in recent years by repeatedly cutting the foreign aid budget to ensure it does not exceed David Cameron’s pledge to devote 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income to the issue. But better than expected growth figures mean that when he makes his Autumn Statement on the economy on Thursday, Mr Osborne is facing the prospect of having to increase foreign aid in order to hit the spending threshold. The money involved is expected to total around £1billion over the next five years, although the Chancellor is understood to have avoided the need to provide extra cash in this financial year. The move will fuel criticism that the ‘arbitrary’ aid target is more about political posturing than saving lives. In August it emerged that Nigeria, which will receive £1.14billion in foreign aid from Britain over the five years of the Coalition, is spending millions to put a man in space. The oil-rich country is also mired in corruption. Estimates suggest between £2.5 and £5billion is stolen from the state’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians. Britain is also spending about £280million a year on aid to India, another country with its own space programme. Last night Tory MP Peter Bone described the increase as ‘absurd’. He said: ‘The aid budget is going to go up, not because there is more need for it or more poverty in the world, but because we have got better economic growth – it is a nonsense. This is why these arbitrary targets are such a mistake. 'We are still borrowing billions a month but, because growth has gone up, we are going to borrow even more so that we can give it away. Oil-rich: Nigeria will receive £1.14billion in foreign aid from Britain over the five years of the Coalition. Above, the Total Nigeria onshore oil and gas refinery at Amenam in the delta of the Niger River in Nigeria . Pledge: David Cameron, left, pledged to hit the aid target as part of a pre-election strategy to 'decontaminate' his party's uncaring image, while Tory MP Peter Bone, right, has described the increase in aid as 'absurd' ‘It is a bizarre and stupid approach – to be honest it’s the sort of thing you would expect from a socialist government.’ Mr . Cameron’s pledge to hit the aid target was part of a pre-election . strategy to ‘decontaminate’ the Tories’ uncaring image, but he has come . under pressure to drop it in the wake of the financial crisis. In March, Mr Osborne said the aid budget would hit £11.2billion this year – more than the Home Office budget. Aid was cut in the Budget, when the growth forecast for this year was reduced from 1.2 per cent to 0.6 per cent. Experts believe the forecast is likely to be upgraded to 1.4 per cent this week, requiring the Chancellor to at least reverse the March cuts, which amounted to £1billion over five years. The Treasury declined to comment, but confirmed that the 0.7 per cent aid target will be met. The Department for International Development also declined to comment. One of the biggest recipients of British aid money was last night accused of covering up allegations of corruption. Supporters: The Global Fund's backers include Bill Gates, right, and U2 singer Bono, left . The Swiss-based Global Fund, which is set to receive £1 billion from Britain over the next three years, is said to have watered down a report into corruption in one of its projects in Cambodia. The publication of investigations into alleged fraud totalling more than £16.5 million in parts of Africa is said to have been delayed for more than a year. The Global Fund’s backers include Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates and celebrities such as U2 singer Bono and supermodel Carla Bruni, wife of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. It is one of the world’s biggest aid organisations, with a focus on tackling malaria, tuberculosis and Aids in the developing world. It has spent £13.5 billion over the last decade and claims to have saved millions of lives. An investigation by the BBC’s Panorama programme last night made disturbing new claims about the organisation’s attitude to fraud. The Global Fund said it had a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to corruption. It defended its investigation into the Cambodia project, saying: ‘Only evidence that is confirmed as fact can be included in the final version of a report.’ A Department for International Development source said the Panorama programme related to ‘historic’ allegations, and that ministers had confidence in the Global Fund.\n",

Data for millions of cards are being sold on black markets for $20-$100 . One man speeding in Brooklyn was pulled over and cops found $20,000 worth of Apple goods bought with gift cards that had been purchased using the stolen credit card data . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:35 EST, 21 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:41 EST, 21 December 2013 . The CEO of Target has apologized for slower call center and website access and is now offering a 10 percent discount to lure customers back into stores, after a massive data breach left information of about 40 million shoppers vulnerable to hackers. CEO Gregg Steinhafel said on Friday that the issue of unauthorized access to payment card data at their U.S. stores 'has been identified and eliminated', and not all customers who shopped between Black Friday and last week are victims of fraud. 'Most importantly, we want to reassure guests that they will not be held financially responsible for any credit and debit card fraud,' he told ABC News. 'And to provide guests with extra assurance, we will be offering free credit monitoring services. We will be in touch with those impacted by this issue soon on how and where to access the service.' Steinhafel apologized to guests who tried to reach Target via its website or call center while it faces 'unprecedented call volume'. Out of the store: The credit card data for millions of Target shoppers is now being sold on the black market after a massive security breach that hit more than 40million shoppers . Investigators believe that overseas . hackers were responsible for the cyber attack on Target that compromised . up to 40 million payment cards during the first three weeks of the . holiday shopping season. Brian Krebs, reporting for KrebsOnSecurity.com . reported on Friday that cards stolen from Target were being offered at the black market . 'card shops' for rates starting at $20 each and going to more than $100. A person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to talk publicly about the matter, said that government investigators do not believe that the hackers had inside help. The source declined to say how the hackers got in or where investigators believe they are based, saying investigators don't want to show their hand to the criminals or afford them a chance to destroy evidence. A Secret Service spokesman declined comment on the investigation, which the agency is running. The retailer reported the breach on Thursday, a day after news broke of the attack. Target has declined to say how its systems were compromised and has provided few other details about the case. Spokeswoman Molly Snyder released a written statement on Friday that downplayed the initial impact from the incident. 'To date, we are hearing very few reports of actual fraud, but are closely monitoring the situation,' she said. She said the stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip. The hackers did not obtain PIN numbers used to access ATMs or the three or four-digit security codes that are printed on cards to verify online purchases, Snyder said. She said Target has provided exposed card numbers to Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. Those companies are in turn providing the information to the financial institutions that issue them. The retailer said it was offering a 10 percent discount on December 21 and 22 and free credit monitoring, calling the situation 'confusing and disruptive'. They are also adding more people to answer the phone as some potential credit card fraud victims have said they were having trouble reaching the store. Tricky: Credit card information stolen from a Target customer was used to purchase a gift card that then was used to buy $20,000 worth of Apple products found in a Brooklyn car . A traffic stop may have exposed at least one purchase of stolen data. A speeding driver who was pulled over in Brooklyn on Thursday was found to have up to $20,000 worth of stolen Apple products in his car and now police are investigating whether or not those items were connected to the collection of Target customers' financial data. The accidental discovery came after a series of mistakes on the part of the alleged thieves, as Isiah Ramdaran was pulled over in Flatbush after running a red light. The New York Post reports that when he opened the glove compartment to get his registration papers, police saw that it was also holding a loaded 32-caliber handgun. That reveal prompted police to search the vehicle and they found Target bags filled with 17 Apple iPad Airs, 14 Apple iPad Minis and 11 iTouches. Those Apple products are not believed to have been used to steal the information, but instead they may be the byproduct of it since they were purchased with gift cards that had been bought with the stolen credit card information. Target spokeswoman said the stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip and she tried on Friday to downplay the situation . There were two . other men in the car but their names have not been released, though they . were charged with possession of stolen property and a gun alongside . 21-year-old Isiah Ramdaran. All of the Apple products in the car were bought in Target stores across Long Island and neighboring areas. Those were far from the only stores effected by the credit card data theft, which is the second biggest in U.S. history. An earlier theory about the theft suggested that hackers broke into Target's computer system and installed data mining software on credit card machines. That software is installed on 40,000 machines across the 1,797 stores in the U.S. All the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet over the course of three weeks before the theft was discovered. The software could have spread through the Target network after being installed on a company machine, possibly by fooling an employee into clicking on a fake link in a 'phishing' scam. The breach did not affect online purchases, Target officials said.\n",

Russian former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has been reunited with his family after being freed from prison and arriving in Berlin . Russia's former richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky has revealed he was stabbed in the nose during a gruelling 10-year prison term. The 50-year-old oil magnate was freed two days ago from his 'politically-motivated' sentence by the Russian authorities, who many claim are trying to improve their image before February's Winter Olympics. Today the long-standing rival to President Putin gave an emotional press conference in which he vowed to keep campaigning for political prisoners - but admitted he will no longer be involved in the 'struggle for power'. He urged the world not to boycott the Games in Sochi, saying it was a time for sport not politics. Yet he also insisted the global event should not be turned into 'a great party for President Putin'. Giving his first TV interview to CNN, Khodorkovsky shed light on his terrifying time in jail. He said: 'When I was stabbed with a knife I was lucky - he tried to get to my eye but he got my nose. 'As a result, the dentist who was there - someone who was also a plastic surgeon - carried out an operation on me, which means it was virtually not noticeable.' Asked whether he forgave Putin, he replied: 'I would put it differently, perhaps. I . don't think that revenge would be any rational behavior. And something . that is rational behaviour I can always deal with.' The former chairman of the Yukos Oil Company was jailed for tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement in 2003 - charges he denied - and was supposed to be released next August, but was freed early two days ago. Officials insist he was freed on humanitarian grounds because his mother Marina, 79, is ill. During today's press conference, held somewhat appropriately in Germany's Berlin Wall museum, he thanked media pressure and German officials for . helping secure the release from his 'political' sentence.

A lawyer who posed as a wealthy investor to con two venture capitalists out of £250,000 has been jailed for six years. Gordon Manson, 48, from Edinburgh, used the cash in an attempt to negotiate the takeover of a business worth £19million. His scam was only foiled when the owner of the company mentioned the deal to a friend over drinks and was told Manson was a conman. Jailing him at the Old Bailey, Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London, told Manson: 'Your whole lifestyle has been self-centred and based on dishonesty and self-delusion.' He added: 'You gave every appearance that your . interest in that company was genuine, using professional advisers. 'Subsequently your true identity was discovered and you were arrested. ‘You were financing these activities . on the back of two loans from venture finance companies. This was . fraudulent from the outset and professionally planned.’ The Old Bailey heard Manson first made an approach to invest in Avanta, a serviced office company, in late 2010. Posing as Fraser Henderson, he claimed he was ‘cash rich’ with a portfolio of serviced offices outside London. In May 2012 he made another approach . to buy the business and met with the owner David Alberto at the Westbury . Hotel in Mayfair to discuss the deal. Manson claimed he ran a property . investment business and spent most of his time in Andorra and Madrid. He . also claimed that he had access to a £50million fund to invest, although prosecutor Antony Swift said there is not believed to be any truth to the claims. Mr Alberto spent £80,000 in professional fees relating to the deal before learning ‘Henderson’ was in fact a conman named Gordon Manson. In 2003, Manson, a qualified solicitor, was jailed for five years in 2003 after attempting a similar £17million fraud in Edinburgh. After the discovery, Mr Alberto contacted police and then arranged a meeting with Manson at an office in London so the fraudster could be arrested. Old Bailey Judge Brian Barker said Manson based his life on 'dishonesty and self-delusion' as he jailed him for six years . Manson later admitted that he had obtained loans worth £250,000 in order to finance the acquisition of Avanta, including £100,000 from Jeremy Keith and £150,000 from Zafir Rafiq. Both loans were backed by personal guarantees which had been falsified by Manson. Mr Swift said: ‘He used false documentation about his own financial worth and false accounts, all giving the impression he was a man of substance when he was in fact a man of straw. ‘His explanation was the deal could have worked and nobody would have lost anything. The Crown say that is simply untrue. ‘Clearly when a fraudster like the defendant is looking to buy a company like Avanta the risk is once he gets his foot in the door he will use its good standing in order to fleece them and line his pockets.’ Defence barrister Wayne Cleaver said all of the money had been spent on surveyors, lawyers and ‘other expenses’ and there was nothing left. Manson pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud by false representation. The judge sentenced him to 32 months for the Avanta fraud. He was also sentenced for 40 months for each of the bridging loan frauds to be served concurrently.\n",

For most people, Martin Scorsese’s latest offering, The Wolf of Wall Street, is nothing more than an entertaining film about glamorous and despicable con men - but for Christina McDowell it is a slice of her past that continues to haunt her. McDowell is the daughter of Tom Prousalis, a former business associate of Jordan Belfort, the self-described Wolf of Wall Street who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the new film currently out in theaters. In an open letter published in LA Weekly Thursday, McDowell condemned the makers of the film and its star, Mr DiCaprio, accusing them of glorifying fraud and celebrating greed with little regard for the consequences of the swindlers' actions. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, pictured earlier this month at a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street, have been criticized in an open letter written by the daughter of a con man . Wrong message: Christina McDowell accused the makers of the film, which follows the rise and fall of penny stock swindler Jordan Belfort as played by Mr DiCaprio, of celebrating greed and crime . McDowell, who explained in the letter that she was forced to change her name after her father had stolen her identity, said that she was 18 years old in 2004 when Prousalis, then 55, went on trial for penny stock fraud. At the time, The Washington Post described the case as a postscript to the 'pump-and-dump' scandals of the previous decade related to several shell companies that cost unsuspecting investors millions of dollars in losses. Prousalis was the securities attorney for the bogus businesses, which were taken public by Stratton Oakmant, Inc owned by Belfort in order to defraud investors to the tune of some $200million. McDowell recounted that when her father first went into business with Belfort and his ilk, she and her family were living a charmed life. 'I drove a white Range Rover in high school, snorted half of Colombia, and got any guy I ever wanted because my father would take them flying in his King Air,' she said of the heady 90s. But for McDowell, her mother and two sisters it all came crashing down when the truth behind Belfort's scheme began unraveling. Stinging rebuke: McDowell wrote that Scorsese's film glorifies the same bad behavior that nearly brought American economy to its knees a few years ago . Landed on his feet: Real-life Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort, pictured right with his wife, served 22 months in prison and was ordered to pay $110.4million, but reinvented himself ans an author and motivational speaker . When her father surrendered to prison in the fall of 2004 after pleading guilty to securities fraud charges, his 18-year-old daughter drove him. When Christine returned home that day, she was inundated with phone calls from her father’s creditors and attorneys representing swindled investors threatening to sue the 18-year-old girl. 'He'd left me in nearly $100,000 worth of debt,' she wrote of her jailed father. 'He left and never told me.' Once all of Prousalis’ money was gone, much of it used to repay the investors, the family fell on hard times. McDowell’s 17-year-old sister ran away from home, while her older sibling struggled to finish school. Christine McDowell described it as a confusing experience, going from her father's private jet to waiting table for meager tips. 'I couch surfed for two years, . sometimes dressing out of my car and stealing pieces of salami out of my . boyfriends' refrigerators in the middle of the night, ‘ she wrote, . ‘because I was so hungry and so ashamed that I couldn't feed myself.' McDowell, . now in her late 20s, concluded her letter with a lengthy rant against . Scorsese and DiCaprio - 'Marty and Leo’ - calling them 'dangerous' and . rebuking them for making a film that turns financial schemes rooted in . greed into entrainment. Punishment: McDowell's father, a securities lawyer not portrayed in the movie, went to prison in 2004 for securities fraud in connection to Belfort's scam . Sexist: McDowell also railed again what she called blatant misogyny on display in the film . ‘We want to get lost in what? These phony financiers' fun sexcapades and coke binges? Come on, we know the truth,’ she said. ‘This kind of behavior brought America to its knees.’ She also accused the filmmakers of aligning themselves with Belfort  - in her words an accomplished criminal – who has yet to make full restitution to his victims. Belfort was indicted in 1998 for securities fraud and money laundering. After cooperating with the FBI, he served 22 months in prison and was ordered to pay back $110.4million – about half of the total losses incurred by his investors. Since his release from prison, Belfort penned two memoirs, including The Wolf of Wall Street which served as the basis for Scorsese’s movie, and has been touring the world as a motivational speaker. In her ire-filled letter addressed to the creators of the film and Belfort himself, McDowell drove the point home, saying that a man like Belfort does not deserve to be a protagonist in a movie. As a parting salvo, Prousalis’s daughter concluded her letter by urging 'every human in America' not to support Scorsese's film. ‘Because if you do, you're simply continuing to feed the Wolves of Wall Street,' she wrote. In a postscript, McDowell added that her father is now doing business with the Albanian government and is married to a 30-year-old translator.\n",

Christian Taylor was sentenced to 27 months in jail after stealing nearly £100,000 from church funds . A church treasurer who stole £100,000 from ecclesiastical funds by forging the signature of the vicar, has been sentenced to more than two years behind bars. Christian Taylor was responsible for the bank accounts of St Nicholas Church in Great Kimble and All Saints Church in Little Kimble, Buckinghamshire. But two months into his voluntary role as treasurer, the 61-year-old started to line his own pockets. Taylor made a series of false claims to the Listed Places of Worship (LPW) Scheme - a Government programme that allows churches to claim back VAT on building works. The four claims, totaling £54,535, were made using the forged signature of Janet Henderson, the newly appointed vicar of the two churches. Once the money from the false claims landed in the church bank accounts, Taylor transferred the cash to himself. In addition Taylor stole another £42,358 from other church funds. Prosecutor Rachel Drake told Aylesbury Crown Court said Taylor's crimes had gone undetected for two years. She said the 61-year-old started as treasurer in May 2008, but it was not until May 2010, when a new manager at the Natwest branch where the Kimble church accounts were held, that Taylor's wrongdoing was exposed. 'Kay Smith, the new manager, was concerned about the frequency with which the defendant was going into the bank and withdrawing cash from the church accounts,' Miss Drake told the court. She said Taylor was sometimes spotted in the bank branch several times a day. Mrs Smith wrote to one of the signatories of the church accounts, Michael Smith, but Taylor told him he would deal with the issue. In July 2010 Taylor met with the bank, with a man pretending to be Mr Smith, who said the church was happy with his work. Taylor began lining his own pockets with money through false claims to recoup VAT on building works that were never carried out, two months into his voluntary role at St Nicholas Church in Great Kimble, above . A spot-check made on behalf of the LPW scheme involved a check made with an architect listed on one of Taylor's claims. When asked if there was an invoice for the work allegedly carried out, the architect said no invoice existed. When police arrested Taylor in March 2011, officers discovered one of the fake invoices saved on his computer. 'Police have been trying to identify . the other person who must have been working alongside this defendant but . he said he can’t remember the meeting at the bank,' said Miss Drake. 'Not . only has this put the church council into severe financial . difficulties, it has also had a detrimental effect on relationships in . this community.' The court was told Taylor had a string of previous convictions for theft dating from the 1960s and 70s, including theft by an employee in 1971. Martin Bloor, defending Taylor, told Judge . Sheridan: 'He accepts his behaviour showed planning and sophistication . in relation to the documents used.' The court heard £54,000 had yet to be recovered and that Taylor suffered from mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Taylor, who was also treasurer for All Saints Church in Little Kimble, pictured, was only found out after a new bank manager at the Natwest branch. which held the church accounts, spotted the unusual goings on . 'He says he did not intend to hurt . anybody personally but accepts it has and is ashamed of the effect it . has had on these people,' said Mr Bloor. Judge Sheridan said Taylor, from Stokenchurch, acted 'deliberately . and systematically' in beginning the fraud so soon after his appointment . in May 2008. 'Everybody . took you on face value as a thoroughly good egg, but sure as eggs is . eggs, they did not know about your old convictions,' he said. He said Rev. Henderson, Mr Smith and all other church . representatives were blameless victims of Taylor’s fraud, which had also . cost the church council more than £22,000 in legal fees and investigations. 'I . wish to pay tribute to the bank manager, who excelled in her vigilance . in keeping a close eye on the affairs of her customers,' he said. Taylor, . who works as a telephone canvasser and admitted the crimes, was sentenced to a . total of 27 months in prison for two charges of fraud and two of transferring criminal property. A third charge of fraud and one of . possession of articles for use in fraud were ordered to lie on file. An order to recover the money under the Proceeds of Crime Act was also made, a hearing is due to take place on March 14.\n",

The soldier accused of killing 16 villagers in a nighttime rampage in Afghanistan returned to his base wearing a cape and with the blood of his victims on his rifle, belt, shirt and pants, a military prosecutor said Monday. Staff Sgt. Robert Bales was incredulous when fellow U.S. soldiers drew their weapons on him when he returned to Camp Belambay in southern Afghanistan last March, prosecutor Lt. Col. Jay Morse said as a preliminary hearing opened at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. Bales then turned to one sergeant at the scene and said: 'Mac, if you rat me out...' Morse said. A courtroom sketch of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, third from left, during his hearing last month . Robert Bales is charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder . Bales, 39, has been charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder in one of the worst atrocities of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Nine of the victims were children. The hearing will help determine whether the case goes to a court martial. Bales has not entered a plea. His attorneys have not discussed the evidence in the case, but say Bales has PTSD and suffered a concussive head injury during a prior deployment to Iraq. The father of two from Lake Tapps, Wash., sat beside one of his civilian lawyers, Emma Scanlan, in green fatigues as an investigating officer read the charges against Bales and informed him of his rights. Bales said, 'Sir, yes, sir,' when asked if he understood them. Morse said Bales seemed utterly normal in the hours before the March 11 killings. With his colleagues, Bales watched the movie 'Man on Fire,' a fictional account of a former CIA operative on a revenge rampage. Just before he left the base, Morse said, Bales told a Special Forces soldier that he was unhappy with his family life, and that the troops should have been quicker to retaliate for a roadside bomb attack that claimed one soldier's leg. 'At all times he had a clear understanding of what he was doing and what he had done,' said Morse, who described Bales as lucid, coherent and responsive. Bales is accused of slipping away from the remote outpost with an M-4 rifle outfitted with a grenade launcher to attack the villages of Balandi and Alkozai, in a dangerous district. American officials have said they believe Bales broke the slaughter into two episodes - walking first to one village, returning to the base and slipping away again to carry out the second attack. The prosecutor said Bales returned to the base at one point, telling a colleague about shooting people at a village. The soldier apparently took it as a bad joke and responded: 'Quit messing around.' Bales' hearing is taking place in a military courtroom on Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington state . The defense team for Bales, second from left in this courtroom sketch, are preparing for his case to go to court martial . Innocent: Kari Bales told ABC News last month: 'My husband did not do this. I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that my husband is not involved' Prosecutors played for the first time a video captured by a surveillance blimp that showed a caped figure running toward the base, then stopping and dropping his weapons as he's confronted. There is no audio. Morse said Bales was the caped figure. After being taken into custody, Morse said, Bales said: 'I thought I was doing the right thing.' The hearing is scheduled to run as long as two weeks, and part of it will be held overnight to allow video testimony from witnesses, including an estimated 10 to 15 Afghans, in Afghanistan. Bales' attorney, John Henry Browne, said the hearing will give the defense a chance to see what the government can prove. They are expecting a court martial. Bales is an Ohio native who joined the Army in late 2001 - after the 9/11 attacks - as his career as a stockbroker imploded. An arbitrator entered a $1.5 million fraud judgment against him and his former company that went unpaid, and his attempt to start an investment firm in Florida also failed. He was serving his fourth combat tour after three stints in Iraq, and his arrest prompted a national discussion about the stresses posed by multiple deployments. Scanlan, his attorney, declined to say to what extent the lawyers hope to elicit testimony that could be used to support a mental-health defense. Bales himself will not make any statements because his lawyers said he would have nothing to gain. Bodies of Afghan civilians, allegedly shot by US soldier Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, loaded into the back of a van in Alkozai village of Panjwayi district, Kandahar province . Man on Fire: The movie Bales watched with colleagues before allegedly carrying out 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder . Bales' wife, Kari, who plans to attend the hearing, had complained about financial problems on her blog in the year before the killings, and noted Bales was disappointed at being passed over for a promotion. Browne described those stresses as garden-variety - nothing that would prompt such a massacre - and has also said, without elaborating, that Bales suffered a traumatic incident during his second Iraq tour that triggered 'tremendous depression.' Bales remembers little or nothing from the time of the attacks, the defense said. Scanlan, who deferred an opportunity to give an opening statement, said the Army had only recently turned over a preliminary DNA trace evidence report from the crime scenes, but defense experts have not had time to review it. Bales, who spent months in confinement at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., before being transferred to Lewis-McChord last month, is doing well, Scanlan said. Kari Bales maintains that her husband is innocent and was not responsible for the senseless slayings. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, she said she finds it 'incomprehensible' that her husband and best friend, 'Bob,' faces 16 charges of premeditated murder. 'It doesn't seem possible. Especially that there were women and children,' she said. 'My heart goes out to those families that lost loved ones, parents and grandparents. I am a mom; I can't imagine losing my child, especially to something like that.' Ms Bales said she learned of the . attack within hours from military officials and her initial reaction was . that 'it must have been a mistake.' 'It . certainly wasn't, it wasn't my husband,' she said. 'I know my husband. I know . him very well, and especially the talk about the women and the children. I knew that it wasn't my husband. So it was just incomprehensible to . me.' Speaking to her husband in the middle of that March night confirmed to her that even he didn't know what really happened. Changing tales: Bales' lawyer says the army should take greater responsibility for sending soldiers into combat who are suffering from PTSD and head injuries, but now he seems grateful for the plea deal . Bales will not make any statements in court because his lawyers said he would have nothing to gain . 'He was like, 'What? What you talking about?' He had, he knew that something was going on, but did not know the extent of what was going on, and I was actually the one that had told him how many people had died, and that included women and children, and he was blown away. He did not know the details as they had been portrayed in the press.' But Kari told ABC News she believes the . truth has yet to come out. 'I don't think we have even begun to have the truth.' In the meantime, Ms Bales said she . finds it hard explaining to the couples' two-year-old son and . five-year-old daughter why their father is sitting in a jail cell. 'It's . been difficult,' she said. 'I question myself, what is the right thing . to say, what is the right thing to explain to them, what can they . understand? And for me, I don't even really understand what is . happening, so how can I possibly expect my kids to understand, right?' Media coverage: Television trucks  parked near the military courtroom where Robert Bales' preliminary hearing is taking place . But the family regularly travels the mere mile to where Bales' has been calling home. Their conversations are monitored but at least, she says, they can be a family. 'We are together, we're as a family. We're regular; we can look forward to it. We know when we are going to see him again. It's somewhat normal,' she said. To help pay what could end up being millions of dollars in legal fees, Ms Bales has set up a website, www.helpsgtbales.com, where people can donate to the SSG Bales Legal Defense Fund. 'Really the reason we need a defense fund is to get a fair trial out of this. I really feel Bob gave his best for his country. Now it is time for America to give their best to him.' She told the TV station that she tries not to dwell on the possibility that her husband may spend his life behind bars or worse, face the death penalty. 'I have come to terms with that, and that I have put away. You know, I thought about it and I put it away until I actually have to deal with it. So you, I have learned to compartmentalize a lot of these issues, too. Yes, I've thought about it and yes, that scares me.'\n",

Admission: Nigel Farage said he opened an offshore trust fund to slash his tax bill but never used it . Nigel Farage was today branded a 'hypocrite' after admitting he opened an  offshore trust fund to slash his tax bill while campaigning against tax avoidance. The leader of the UK Independence Party set up a scheme on the Isle of Man for ‘inheritance purposes’. But he claimed he never used it saying: ‘It was a mistake. I’m not rich enough.’ Mr Farage told fellow members of the European Parliament last month that they had a ‘common enemy – rich people, successful companies evading tax’. Labour MP John Spellar said: 'I know Nigel Farage wants to appeal to disaffected Tories, but copying some of the Tories' biggest donors by using offshore trusts to avoid tax is taking things too far. 'It's typical of UKIP - they talk about how much they love this country, but they don't even bank here - it's just hypocritical.' While Mr Farage's trust is within the law, he has attacked Brussels bureaucrats on £100,000 a year who pay just 12 per cent tax on their income. He said: ‘It is tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale, how can that be fair?’ Mr Farage, a former City commodities trader, created the Farage Family Educational Trust 1654 ten years ago, according to documents seen by the Daily Mirror. Accounts reveal he owned shares in this trust briefly during 2004, having transferred shareholdings from his trading firm – Farage Ltd. That meant the offshore trust owned 50 per cent of his firm. He set up the trust with his brother Andrew, who pocketed £969,000 in dividends from his trading firm. Mistake: Mr Farage said that setting up the account was a mistake because he is 'not rich enough' An embarrassed Mr Farage said: ‘My . financial advisors recommended I did it, to have a trust really for . inheritance purposes and I took the advice and I set it up. It was a . mistake. 'I was a completely unsuitable person for it. I am not blaming them it was my fault.’ The . UKIP leader said it was an ‘educational trust’ to ‘build up a trust . fund for your children or grandchildren’s school fees, things like . that’. Costly: Tax avoidance has been top of Prime Minister David Cameron's agenda at this week's G8 summit in Northern Ireland . But he added: ‘Firstly, I’m not rich enough to need one and I am never going to be. ‘Secondly frankly the world’s changed. Things that we thought were absolutely fair practice ten, 20 years ago aren’t any more. 'Thirdly, it was a mistake because it cost me money, I sent a cheque to set it up.’ Tax avoidance has been at the top of David Cameron’s agenda at this week’s G8 summit in Northern Ireland. It is estimated to cost Britain £35billion a year. Mr Farage’s accountant confirmed all the dividends were paid to Andrew Farage, who insisted he had paid all his taxes. He added: ‘I packed up business completely in 2004.’ Nigel Farage declared to the EU Parliament in January 2004 that he was a paid director of Farage Ltd. He became UKIP leader in 2006, and his EU register states he was paid for commodity broking every year from 2004 to 2009 when this was his only business appointment according to Companies House records. He remained a shareholder in Farage Ltd until 2011. It is now subject to a ‘voluntary order’ – one step from bankruptcy’ and has debts of more than £130,000 to be paid off by 2017. There is no inheritance tax and most companies pay no corporation tax on the Isle of Man where tax avoidance is a huge industry.\n",

Jailed: Cynical con artist David Bowerman, 35, from Chelmsford, Essex,  swindled up to £7.5 million from investors including terminally ill cancer patients through a massive Ponzi scheme . A cynical con artist who swindled up to £7.5 million from investors including terminally ill cancer patients through a massive Ponzi scheme has been jailed. David Bowerman, 35, from Chelmsford, Essex, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle as he blew a fortune on fast cars, luxury holidays and a toxic gambling habit after investors pumped millions of pounds into his bogus scheme. More than 250 people were taken in by the intricate con including Manchester City ace Richard Wright, 35, who handed over £400,000. Bowerman blew investors' cash on three Caribbean cruises and a whole host of flashy cars including a £38k Audi sports car, a BMW and an Aston Martin. The charismatic con man - who was seen lighting cigarettes with a £50 note - even stole £36,500 from his own mother, Cynthia Bowerman, to fund his affluent lifestyle. He eventually handed himself in to police in August 2010 as his debts mounted and demands for repayment from frustrated investors became unbearable. Bowerman did not react as he was sentenced to eight years in prison at Chelmsford Crown Court today. The former investment advisor wore a grey suit and stared emotionlessly from the dock as the court heard a harrowing list of his many victims. The list included two terminally ill cancer sufferers who invested in the scheme in the hope of leaving their loved ones with money after they died. Other victims lost their life savings or pension pots they had worked for years to amass resulting in problems with stress, depression and suicidal thoughts. The court heard it is unlikely any investor in the scheme will ever be refunded. Judge Charles Gratwicke said: 'You acted in a totally wicked, disgraceful and cynical manner without any regard for the effects of your dishonesty on those who trusted you. 'Over the five-year period you quite clearly engaged in multiple acts of dishonesty obtaining something in the region of £7.5m. 'There must clearly be a substantial prison sentence to reflect the effect it had on your victims.' The Ponzi scheme worked by offering existing investors money from new investors to give the impression of a profit-making business. Duped: More than 250 people were taken in by the intricate con including Manchester City ace Richard Wright, 35, who handed over £400,000. The goalkeeper is seen here playing for Everton . Bowerman began in early 2005 by selling fake bonds and offering loans under the pretence his experience as an FSA-approved financial advisor would help boost their credit rating. Records show that the charismatic crook blew vast amounts of his investors' cash with unsuccessful betting sprees at online websites such as www.bet365.com. Ironically - despite his woeful record with online betting - Bowerman then set up an online bookmaker called Shearer Hare and encouraged friends and family to invest heavily in it - using the funds to give the impression of a profit-making business. The business generated £4.85m but £3.8m soon disappeared through online betting by Bowerman with an unknown amount being blown on his increasingly lavish lifestyle. Antony Swift, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant systematically and cynically defrauded family, friends and acquaintances out of large sums of money. 'The total sum is in excess of £7 million. 'He raised funds in order to feed an insatiable gambling habit. 'It was characteristic of the defendant's offending that he would keep going back to get as much as he could off his victims.' The court heard that nearing the end of Bowerman's five-year con he began targeting big money earners as his debts mounted. Mr Swift continued: 'His victims included the footballer Richard Wright, Manchester City goalkeeper, and Peter Stroud, former chairman of Chelmsford City football club. Luxurious: Bowerman used the money he swindled to fund a lavish lifestyle, which included buying an Aston Martin. This is a file picture of an Aston Martin Vanquish V12 sports car . 'These people had large amounts of cash at their disposal. 'The defendant needed large amounts of cash to keep his various balls in the air so he persuaded them to invest in separate schemes. 'He was telling them there was a particular betting syndicate guaranteed to make money and large returns - but the returns never came.' Peter Stroud, 46, the former chairman of FA Cup giant-killers Chelmsford City Football Club, was one of Bowerman's biggest victims after handing over more than £1 million to the former mortgage advisor. The father-of-four said: 'I hope he dies in prison. 'The impact he has had on so many lives is unbelievable. It has had a massive impact on my family.'I trusted him implicitly. 'He worked for a good company and I had known him for ten years. He was charismatic and flamboyant but what he did, he did with malice. 'He did it to buy himself an Aston Martin and there were pictures of him on Facebook lighting his cigarette with a £50 note he had set fire to. 'That is what a fraudster does and, looking back, I realise there were small signs and I have blamed myself. 'He took over a million pounds from me. I was wealthy and had a good life, the money I gave him was to pay off the mortgage on a new house in Little Waltham and pay off my ex-wife's mortgage. Mitigation: BBC presenter Alexis Conran, left, praised Bowerman for being 'instrumental' in helping put together BBC3 documentary 'Gambling Addiction and Me: The Real Hustler' in a character reference read out in court.

I get up at 4am.'I had to sell my business and am selling off a home in Cornwall. 'My children were used to a dad who had money and now when they want an ice cream I have to say no. 'There was a moment when I thought everyone would be better off without me, but things are improving now and I have a new company which is doing well. 'It will just be about working hard and in a few years I hope to look back and see this as an experience.' Bowerman had pleaded guilty to 33 charges of fraud - including 17 offences of fraud by false representation, 14 offences of obtaining money transfer by deception, one of theft and one of participation in a company on a fraudulent basis - when he appeared at an earlier hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court in September 2012. Christopher Kerr, mitigating, today told the court of his client's 'deep shame' over his actions. He said: 'He does express deep shame and remorse for he did. 'He is very aware of the very great loss, both financial and emotional, he has caused. 'It is clear the offences were the result of a chronic and acute gambling addiction. 'He did believe he could turn all of this around by gambling. He accepts that that belief was thoroughly deluded and without foundation. 'It was not his intent to cause a loss.' The court was told that, since handing himself in August 2010 and being released on bail, Bowerman has undergone intensive treatment for gambling addiction and has begun lobbying parliament to regulate the gambling industry. He has helped set up a campaign group called Gambling Reform and Society Perception (GRASP) and has contributed towards BBC and Channel 4 documentaries on the subject. BBC presenter Alexis Conran praised Bowerman for being 'instrumental' in helping put together BBC3 documentary 'Gambling Addiction and Me: The Real Hustler' in a character reference read out in court. He added: 'I am very sure he has helped many gambling addicts and their families avoid ruin.' Detective Constable Peter Sutton, from the Kent and Essex Fraud Squad, said: 'David Bowerman's criminality touched the lives of over 250 people and netted him in excess of £7.5 million. 'Some of his victims suffered more than once as he continued to abuse their trust whilst he fraudulently raised funds to feed his insatiable appetite for gambling and to finance a lavish lifestyle way beyond his legitimate means. 'The cynical way in which Bowerman exploited the trust of his victims is the worst example seen by the case office in over 28 years of police service. 'Bowerman has caused considerable hardship and loss to his victims from which many are likely never to be able to recover.'\n",

A 66-year-old woman looking for love online ended up with a broken heart and bank account when she lost $500,000 to suitor on a Christian dating site. The San Jose divorcee met a Nigerian man on ChristianMingle.com falsely claiming to be Irish citizen 'David Holmes', according to the Santa Clara District Attorney's Office. Holmes said he worked on a Scottish oil rig, and his profile picture turned out to be a picture of a male model downloaded from the internet. The two never met in person, but talked over the phone and Holmes even sent the woman flowers. Scammed: A 66-year-old woman lost $500,000 to a man she met on ChristianMingle.com but was able to recover $200,000 . Eventually he convinced her to loan him $300,000 for his oil business - funds she supplied from her retirement account. After wiring him an additional $200,000 to a bank in Turkey, the woman got suspicious and informed the DA's office. Cherie Bourland of the elder fraud unit called the bank in Turkey and was successfully able to freeze the funds before Holmes' associate Wisdom Onokpite showed up to withdraw the money, according to CBS San Francisco. Onokpite was arrested by the Turkish National Police on suspicion of committing fraud. The DA's office traced Holmes to Nigeria - a 'hot bed of online scams' - and he remains free. While the woman was able to get her $200,000 back, Ms Bourland says there's just a '1 per cent' chance she'll recover the over $300,000 because 'it's just impossible to track down' and federal authorities won't investigate losses below $1million. Ms Bourland says reports of lost money on dating sites has been on the rise, especially among the elderly since 'studies show the ability to make financial decisions is the first to be affected by aging.' 'You get the love drug in you and you end up getting duped,' she told the San Jose Mercury News.\n",

The theft of personal information from more than 100million South Korean credit cards and accounts, reportedly including those of President Park Geun-hye and UN chief Ban Ki-moon, has ignited a storm of anger and litigation against credit firms. Worried Koreans on Tuesday packed into branches of one of the banks hit by the theft to ensure their money was safe, while lawyers said 130 people joined a class action suit against their credit card providers in what is expected to be the first of multiple litigations. ‘Of course I'm angry. Anyone might know when I pay my credit card bills, let alone my phone number and where I live. I might as well keep all my money in my closet,’ said one card user, Lee Young-hye, outside a bank branch. Contrite: (left to right) Son Kyung-Ik, head of NH Nonghyup Card, Lotte Card CEO Park Sang-Hoon and KB Kookmin Card CEO Shim Jae-Oh bow to make a joint public apology about the scam . Scam: The data security breach affected around 15million cardholders . The biggest breach of personal privacy ever in South Korea has further highlighted the vulnerability of credit card information after tens of millions of U.S. cardholders' details were stolen from retailer Target Corp during the holiday shopping season. South Koreans on average have more than four credit cards, something that has contributed to one of the highest levels of personal debt relative to the size of the economy in the developed world. The data security breach affected around 15million cardholders, according to official estimates, by far the largest in a series of such scams against financial firms in South Korea going back to 2011. President Park Geun-hye is said to be one of the millions of victims of the scam . Some previous attacks involved hackers believed to originate from North Korea, but this one seems to have been an inside job. Financial regulators said a contractor with the Korea Credit Bureau, a private firm that manages the credit information of millions of Koreans for financial services providers, simply loaded details of 105.8million accounts held by KB Kookmin Card Co Ltd, Lotte Card Co Ltd and NH Nonghyup Card onto a portable hard drive. The technician was allegedly working on forgery-proofing credit cards when he committed the theft in February, June and December last year, according to regulator Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), citing the prosecutor's office leading the investigation. Accused: The data thief was reportedly working for the Korea Credit Bureau (file picture) The man then sold the information to at least two people including a loan marketer and a broker, the FSS said. The contractor and at least one other person have been arrested. The first class action lawsuit was filed against the three credit card companies late on Monday, a day after the FSS revealed the full scale of the theft, according to the law firm representing them. The victims are each claiming 110million won ($103,400 or £62,000) in compensation. Lawyers said they expected more lawsuits to come, as internet chatrooms and social media seethed with complaints about the security failure. ‘We are preparing additional lawsuits regarding the case and are receiving applications from victims,’ an official at the law firm leading the litigation said. Cho Yeon-haeng, president of Korea Finance Consumer Federation, a customer rights group, said: ‘Proving actual damages will be very difficult, which means at best nominal compensation for emotional injury. ‘What is needed is stopping repercussions by re-issuing all the affected credit cards,’ he added. The stolen information included names, home addresses, and phone numbers, bank account numbers, credit card details, identification numbers, income, marriage and passport numbers. The FSS said credit card passwords were not stolen, although this was cold comfort to South Koreans for whom most credit card transactions simply require a card swipe and signature - without the need for a chip and pin process. Some outlets such as home shopping channels do not even need a signature. South Korean media reported that President Park and UN Secretary General Ban were among those whose information was stolen, although government officials and the card firms declined to comment. Park's office declined to comment, while Ban's office could not be reached to comment. Executives from KB Kookmin Card, Kookmin Bank, NH Nonghyup Card, Lotte Card and Korea Credit Bureau, which hired the contractor, offered to resign as investigators probed how such a massive data theft could have occurred so easily. Credit card spending amounted to 451trillion won ($424.01billion or £258billion) in 2012, accounting for 66 percent of the country's private consumption, according to data from the Credit Finance Association of Korea. The Nilson Report, a California trade journal that tracks the payments industry, said in its August issue that global card fraud rose to a record $11.3billion in 2012, from just under $10billion the year before. Nearly half the losses occurred in the United States, helped by the lack of the more advanced card readers.\n",

Nearly 1,000 military widows have had their pensions snatched by the Ministry of Defence after finding new love, the Mail can reveal. Under controversial Government rules, bereaved wives who sacrificed their careers because of their husband's work in the Armed Forces are being stripped of as much as £10,000 a year if they enter new relationships. Furious campaigners say it is 'obscene' to force a widow to forego the retirement income if she remarries or cohabits with a new partner. 'Entitlement': Army wives, such as the women pictured here at the start of the Falklands war, risk losing their pensions should their husbands die and they remarry . Ministers have said the Coalition will not change the law to treat all widows equally. Their stance has led to claims the Government is breaking the Military Covenant, which David Cameron enshrined in law to set out the nation's duty of care to military personnel, veterans and their families. Chrissie Fraser, 64, from West London, said that she felt betrayed by the Ministry of Defence for seizing her £900 monthly military pension after she found a new partner. Mrs Fraser, who followed Lieutenant-Colonel Clive Fraser on postings around the globe before he died from a heart attack in 2006, said the loss of income had left her stressed and facing hardship. She said: 'We are not asking for handouts, just for our rightful entitlement. My faith in the army which my husband revered has gone. 'I gave my time, and my energy to an institution Clive believed in. 'He thought he had done the best thing for us. I do not feel sorry for myself, I just feel angry now. My years as an Army Wife amount to nothing.' New figures uncovered by Parliamentary questions reveal 987 widows have been deprived of their late husbands pension since 2001. Experts predict more than 1,000 face losing their income this year as bureaucrats launch a crackdown. On average widows forfeit around £3,000 a year. 'Faith is gone': One widow affected by the rule said she had lost faith in the Army, which her dead husband 'revered' The rule applies to the old Armed Forces pension scheme and states that if a widow finds new love they will forfeit their retirement pot. The rule does not apply to widows of troops killed on duty. The scheme was replaced in 2005 by a newer one which allows widows to keep their income if they remarry. Air Marshal Sir Christopher Coville, chairman of the Forces Pension Society, said: 'Many women have sacrificed their own careers to follow their husband's work with the Armed Forces, contributing to their husbands' pensions in loyalty and devotion to spouse and country. 'Forces widows have very little chance to earn money, let alone build a career because they are moved from base to base, often in remote, foreign locations, with very little notice. Many are expected to take on unpaid social and community support roles. 'They have truly earned a share in their husband's pension and to argue otherwise is deeply insulting.' Labour MP Katy Clark, who uncovered the figures, said: 'Taking away these pensions is wrong and unfair and it has caused a lot of anger. No change: Defence minister Anna Soubry said that the pensions rules will not be changed due to the financial implications . 'A serviceman who has built up a pension entitlement expects it to be passed to their spouse when they die. 'A widow who has made a considerable sacrifice should not be placed in the dreadful situation of having to decide whether to remarry or keep their pension.' Some widows decide to secretly cohabit without telling the authorities so that they can keep their income, even though they risk being prosecuted for fraud. Last year Carol Garside, 48, the widow of a Royal Navy diver was jailed after admitting pocketing her Armed Forces pension while living with, and then marrying, another man. Defence Minister Anna Soubry said: 'It has long been the policy of successive Governments that changes or improvement to public sector pension schemes should not be applied retrospectively. 'This is because legacy pension issues cannot be looked at in isolation; addressing one issue would increase the pressure to address legacy issues in all public sector pension schemes, and this would have huge financial implications.'\n",

Millionaire property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz could be thrown out of his £50million Kensington mansion after a £183million grab on his assets by a failed Icelandic bank was sanctioned in court. His grand four-story property, which sits by the Royal Albert Hall, is one of London's most prestigious houses and was used as Harry Selfridge's home in the ITV show Mr Selfridge. Kaupthing Bank collapsed during the financial crisis of 2008, and had allowed Mr Tchenguiz to borrow £1.6billion from them before it went to the wall. Magnate: Property millionaire Robert Tchenguiz, pictured with former girlfriend Caprice and friend Patsy Kensit, could be thrown out of his £50m London mansion, it emerged today . Grandure: His beautiful home, which sits beside the Royal Albert Hall, is being pursued by liquidators representing the failed Icelandic bank Kaupthing. It was used in ITV drama 'Mr Selfridge' starring Jeremy Piven . Exposure: The property, shown here during Mr Selfridge filming, is said to be worth £50million and is one of three assets said to be being pursued via the courts in Guernsey . Last month liquidators successfully gained . an order from the Royal Court of Guernsey allowing them to take assets . from him, including his house, which was the former home of the Royal . College of Organists. His interests in BAE's Hampshire headquarters and a huge Leicestershire BT distribution centre could also be pursued. Mr . Tchenguiz has appealed against the ruling but laws on the Channel . Islands mean his assets can still be taken before a new hearing due . to take place in St Peter Port as early as next month, MailOnline . understands. A decade ago Robert and his sibling Vincent were reportedly worth around £4.5billion but this has now dropped to an estimated £850million. Robbie, as he is known to friends, is married with two children and once had a relationship with model Caprice. He has gained a reputation for partying and when he turned 40 it was reported he splashed £100,000 on a Louis XIV-themed event and hired acrobats from the world famous Cirque du Soleil. Every August he spends the month on his 150ft yacht My Little Violet - named after his daughter - on the Cote d’Azur, mooring near an even bigger yacht owned by his elder brother. Family: Robert Tchenguiz, his brother Vincent Tchenguiz and their sister Lisa Tchenguiz at her 48th Birthday Party in London . Partying: Robert Tchenguiz with his wife Heather, left, and with actress Tara Reid at Annabel's . But he also became known he man who lost £1billion in 24 hours during the ­Icelandic banking ­crisis. In recent years the Serious Fraud Office also brought a series of cases against him and his brother, but these collapsed because of a lack of evidence. They then sued the SFO for £300million because their offices were illegally raided in 2011. The SFO's bungled inquiry meant they also had to pay 80 per cent of the legal costs. The Icelandic claim against him was revealed in The Times today after a series of court orders were made in Guernsey. MailOnline understands there has been prolonged legal argument about where the litigation should take place, with the British Virgin Islands also considered. Case: A ruling at the Royal Courts in Guernsey (pictured) means liquidators acting for Kaupthing say they will pursue Robert Tchenguiz's assets . Mr Tchenguiz's appeal would most likely be pencilled in for April, as they are held quarterly in Guernsey, but the Royal Court there could choose to bring it forward. Until then Stephen Akers, one of the . liquidators, admitted they were 'moving forward with enforcement' although there is likely to be legal ramifications if he is evicted from his home, The Times said.\n",

Wilson doctored business statements to hide his fraudulent activity, using Google Images to copy the signature of author Terry Pratchett (pictured) to sign off audit reports . The manager of an investment fund used Terry Pratchett's signature to help dupe investors out of £22million. Benjamin Wilson, 35, used the money of 'several hundred' investors - including close friends and colleagues - to fund his 'lavish lifestyle', Southwark Crown Court heard. Wilson, who was today jailed for seven years, used the cash to pay for a multimillion-pound home as well as buying racehorses, a luxury sports car and gambling in Las Vegas. He doctored business statements to hide his fraudulent activity, using Google Images to copy the signature of author Terry Pratchett to sign off audit reports, the court heard. He pleaded guilty in December 2013 to two counts of forgery and one of fraud, having previously admitted a charge of operating a collective investment scheme without authorisation. Sentencing Wilson to seven years, Judge Michael Grieve said Wilson had carried out an ‘utterly shameless confidence fraud’ targeting victims who invested money ‘they could ill afford to lose’. He had used the cash to fund a lifestyle of ‘untold lavishness and luxury’, the judge said. ‘You were the sole architect of the fraud from start to finish,’ he said. ‘There may well be some element of living in a world of make believe. ‘At the same time it was a cruel and very sophisticated fraud with only one beneficiary - that was yourself.’ Opening the case earlier, prosecutor Michael Brompton QC said Wilson was a ‘cunning and sophisticated man’ who targeted a large number of victims, many of whom were vulnerable. ‘Between 2003 and 2010 he obtained funds totalling approximately £21.8million from several hundred private investors which he purported to invest in a collective scheme managed by him,’ the barrister said. ‘He offered investors huge returns on their money and pretended that he had succeeded in obtaining them. ‘In fact, most of the money was uninvested and that which was invested produced paltry returns or, more frequently, losses.’ The rest of the money was used to pay for Wilson's ‘extravagant lifestyle’ and to ‘defray the overheads of his business facade’, Mr Brompton said. Most of the investors were recruited by word of mouth including friends and members of his local golf club and later by a firm of financial advisors, the court heard. Some of the investors appeared to be ‘wealthy people’ but most suffered ‘grievous losses’, Mr Brompton said. Wilson, from Verwood, in Dorset, told investors the fund was based in the British Virgin Islands and therefore not under regulation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the court heard. ‘In fact there was no such fund in the British Virgin Islands,’ Mr Brompton said. The money was instead held in the UK bank accounts in Wilson's name, the prosecutor said. In 2008, Wilson used investors' cash to take on new offices in Bournemouth which he refurbished to include a bar, massage room and a games room, the court heard. He recruited new ‘mostly youthful’ employees, including two trainee traders, with no experience of trading on financial markets, the hearing was told. ‘They spent most of their time on computer simulations and rarely traded live,’ Mr Brompton said. The employees were not accomplices and had also invested into the fund which Wilson claimed was now worth more than $100million, the prosecutor said. Wilson, 35, was sentenced today at Southwark Crown Court to seven years in prison . The court heard £20million of investors' cash was paid into Wilson's fund between 2009 and 2010. Less than £4million was invested with brokers, while some £6million was spent on Wilson's personal expenditure, Mr Brompton said. He used the cash to buy a house for £4million with refurbishments costing £500,000 as well as spending £200,000 on cars including a Ferrari California costing £160,000 and £200,000 on racing and racehorses. Other spending included £100,000 on shopping, £75,000 on golf and more than £85,000 on a gambling trip to Las Vegas, the court heard. Some £4million was also spent on business expenses including almost £1million on new offices in Poole, Dorset. Investors included professional rugby player Charles Amesbury, a school friend of one of Wilson's traders, and Keith Satchell, a life assurance company director whose son was Wilson's best friend from childhood, the court heard. Wilson, a Swansea University graduate, who previously worked for computer company Intel, was arrested in June 2011, the hearing was told. The court heard Wilson paid out £4 million to a handful of investors and a further £5.3million had been recovered - leaving £12million still outstanding. The defendant, who has since been declared bankrupt, was jailed for five months in April 2012 for breaching a freezing order imposed by the High Court. Some of Wilson's victims sat in the packed public gallery for today's hearing. One woman sniggered while another man shook his head as Michael Bromley-Martin QC, defending Wilson, told the court that his client's remorse for his actions was ‘unequivocal’. ‘This is a classic example of an apparently intelligent man self deceived by his own capabilities,’ the barrister said. ‘Not unlike an addicted gambler, always believing that he would win in the end.’ Wilson, wearing a shirt and grey jumper in the dock, showed no reaction as he was told he must serve half of his seven-year sentence in prison before being released on licence. He was also banned from working as a company manager or director for 15 years. A confiscation order was made for just £1 due to Wilson's bankruptcy. It is estimated a further £444,500 will be recovered for investors, the court heard.\n",

Fraudster: Mohammed Khatana has been ordered to pay back £1.3million he made through scams . A fraudster who posed as a lawyer and offered 'expert' legal advice to criminals has been told to pay back £1.3million he stole from the taxpayer. Despite having no legal qualifications or accreditation, Mohammed Khatana set up a cowboy consultancy firm offering guidance to crooks that faced having cash and assets seized by police under proceeds of crime laws. The 51-year-old father-of-three - who used his own daughter to act as a front for his scam - then charged vastly inflated fees for his 'services' which he claimed from the taxpayer-funded legal aid scheme. Last September Khatana, of Brierfield, . near Burnley was jailed for eight and a half years after he admitted 15 . charges of fraud. He has now been given six months to pay the money back or face another six years in prison. In a written judgement Judge Graham . Knowles QC said of Khatana: 'He is a professional career criminal who is . resilient and flexible. 'He does not regard imprisonment so . much as an occupational hazard as a necessary part of the work to be . done to obtain money from his crimes, albeit paid in arrears. 'I have regard to his history of . criminality, his use of his mother’s accounts to conceal the financial . realities, to sham property transactions, to the known existence of the . Pakistani bank account and to his failure to provide any information . about it. 'I find it inherently improbable this . man would not commit offences without making very large profits. The . likelihood is that he took large fees for concealing the assets of other . criminals and that he has hidden them or their proceeds.' Preston Crown Court was told how the former property dealer - who drove a Mercedes and lived in a five bedroom house on a private estate in rural Lancashire - advertised his services via a website and in prison newspapers. He would visit clients in jail, discuss their needs, then go away and procure the necessary services for the criminals from solicitors' firms. Khatana would then double the genuine firm's quoted price, submit a legal aid claim to the Legal Services Commission, and pocket the difference himself. Guilty: The website Khatana used to advertise his services before he was jailed for eight and a half years after admitting 15 counts of fraud . The court was also told how the British Muslim used 'cultural pressure' to make his daughter Mahria Khatana participate in his scheming, having her join a lawyers' association and network with defence solicitors and barristers at trade functions. When one of her father's sizeable legal aid claims was queried by a judge, the 25-year-old verified it in court. Khatana was arrested as he left a hotel near Bury after an undercover  operation led by detectives from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, following a three year investigation into his shady firm POCA Consulting Ltd. The sting saw an undercover policewoman pose as the girlfriend of a client to meet with Khatana, who offered her advice on how to keep her partner's money out of the reach of authorities at a cost of £20,000. The court heard how Khatana billed one 74-year-old client facing confiscation proceedings for money laundering £43,000. He should have been charged just £10,000. The money was recouped by the Khatanas through legal aid at the expense of the taxpayer. Mohammed Khatana was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to 15 counts of fraud. Mahria Khatana, who admitted four counts of fraud, was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. Passing sentence, Judge Graham Knowles QC told Khatana senior: 'Your plan from the beginning was that this business would be a vehicle for fraud. 'You are a determined and persistent and versatile professional criminal. What you did was intended to undermine the whole legal process.' Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit said: 'Khatana was a ruthless serial fraudster who was prepared to use his own daughter to steal from a wide range of individuals for his own gain. Luxury: Khatana lived in a five-bedroomed home on a rural private estate in Lancashire and drove a Mercedes coupe . 'Cheating the taxpayer is not a victimless crime especially in these difficult times - yet this man has shown little remorse.' Matthew Coats, chief executive of the Legal Services Commission, said: 'Legal aid funding is public money and we will not tolerate people trying to defraud the taxpayer.' Mohammed Khatana has previously served time in jail for his part in smuggling amphetamine 'pill-making' machines into Britain from China during the 1990s. In a later scam he sent letters to companies up and down the country offering to register them under the then new Data Protection Act, and warning them that they could be prosecuted if they did not pay up. The firms were charged a fee of £135 for Khatana's 'service', when the true cost of registering was £35. He was jailed for four years in December 2004 and ordered to pay back almost £500,000. It was upon his release from prison that Khatana set up his shady legal advice firm POCA Consulting Ltd. Detective Chief Inspector Paula Parker, head of the North West Regional Asset Recovery Team said: 'Khatana was a ruthless and serial fraudster who was prepared to use his daughter to steal from a wide range of people for his own gain. It was clear he was making a large profit by abusing the legal aid system.' 'We will do everything we can to investigate the finances of people who we believe have obtained their money illegally, and then work with the courts to remove negative role models from society and take their wealth off them.'\n",

Tory MP Peter Bone's constituency home was raided by police last year . A Conservative MP was questioned by police over an alleged benefits fraud, it emerged last night. Peter . Bone's home was raided by police as part of a year-long inquiry into . whether his elderly mother-in-law’s assets were deliberately concealed . during her time in a care home. Today the MP for Wellingborough insisted he is 'totally innocent' of allegations of benefit fraud. He also criticised both the county council and the police force over their handling of the case. Downing Street refused to be drawn on the case, pending the outcome of the legal investigations. Mr . Bone was questioned in relation to a dispute with Northamptonshire . County Council about the funding of residential care for his . mother-in-law, Dorothy Sweeney, which is currently the subject of a . civil court case. The Times . reported that questions were asked about concerns that the council was . not given accurate information about Mrs Sweeney's assets before . providing benefits totalling around £100,000. Anyone with assets of more than £23,250 is expected to pay their own care home fees. In . November, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service, which will . decide whether there is enough evidence to lay charges. Last night Mr Bone, who denies any wrongdoing, told the Mail he was facing a ‘personal nightmare at the hands of the police’. He said that today he will complain to the CPS about the way he had been treated. Mr . Bone said: 'Ultimately, the issue at the heart of this dispute is very . simple: either Jennie and I have looked after her mother properly, or we . are devious, thieving, crooks. 'I . know the answer to that question and based on all the evidence, which . they have, they should know too that we are totally innocent.' Mrs . Sweeney has lived in a private care home for seven years but for part . of that time, some of the fees were paid by Northamptonshire County . Council. The local authority is supposed to pay care fees only if the person has assets of less than £23,250. The . police acted over concerns that Mrs Sweeney had just sold a house and . therefore should have been paying the full amount for her care because . she had assets. There is no . suggestion that she acted improperly. Northamptonshire Police said a . 61-year-old man had been interviewed under caution in April ‘in . connection with alleged fraud offences’. Peter Bone and his wife Jennie pictured at home. He has denied any wrongdoing . Mr . Bone said he accepted there was ‘a dispute regarding part of the care . home fees’, and that his family have paid ‘substantial funds’ towards . the fees. ‘It is absolutely untrue that any of Mrs Sweeney’s assets were hidden,’ he said. ‘They . were all declared on the appropriate forms to the county council and . this has never been challenged. There is no shortfall to the county . council for £100,000.' Mr . Bone added: ‘Since March last year, my wife and I have been living . through a surreal nightmare – two people who have always supported and . respected the police, who have had their belief shattered.’ The MP denied the council’s claims and said a civil case with it was ongoing. He has written to the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police about the handling of the case. Mr Bone is one of the Commons’ most colourful characters, often referring to ‘Mrs Bone’ when posing questions to ministers. He . so regularly phrases questions to David Cameron as being on her behalf . that the Prime Minister once told the Commons that ‘a very big part of . my life is trying to give pleasure to Mrs Bone’. Asked . about the allegations today, the Prime Minister's official spokesman . said: ‘I think there's a process going forward here with the appropriate . authorities and that's what should be followed.’ Mr . Bone said the ‘most hurtful’ aspect of the affair was the suggestion . that the couple may have ‘stolen’ his mother-in-law's money.

CPS received a file from Northamptonshire Police concerning a . 61-year-old man formally interviewed under caution in April 2013 in . connection with alleged fraud offences. ‘We will reach a decision in this case as soon as is practicable.’ It is estimated that around 20,000 pensioners a year sell their homes to pay for their own care. Under NHS rules, the majority of pensioners with assets worth more than £23,250 must fund their own care - including practically everyone who owns property. Councils carry out assessments on people who are taken into care, and those who exceed the cap must contribute to costs. Between £14,250 and £23,250 the cost is shared with councils, but above the threshold it is entirely up to those in care. Below £14,250, councils will still draw on a resident's income but will not touch their assets. Councils are required to leave those in care with just £23.50 of their own each week to spend. There are exceptions to the rules if a stay turns out to be temporary, and for those who have mental illnesses. Recently councils have become more willing to investigate the financial affairs of the elderly in order to claw back costs of care. ‘Avoidance inspectors’ trawl through records to try and identify what they call ‘deliberate deprivation’ of assets. Age UK has called for the cap to be raised to £100,000 so that pensioners can protect their homes and pass on more savings to their children. The charity’s director general Michelle Mitchell has previously said: ‘The £23,250 cap is so sharp and is unfair on many people who have worked hard all their lives, because all their assets – including their home – are taken into account. They can see their savings swept away.’\n",

Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted Gino DiCaprio (pictured), whom they had known for 20 years, when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child . A deaf couple desperate to have a baby were scammed out of £12,000 by a friend who told them he could arrange a surrogate birth, a court has heard. Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted Gino DiCaprio, whom they had known for 20 years, when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child. The 52-year-old, who is also deaf following a hit-and-run accident, conned the couple into handing over £6,000, believing that he had arranged a surrogate birth. Then when he told them the child had been born disabled, they parted with another £6,000 pounds for another baby. However, a judge heard that there never were any babies and 'devious liar' DiCaprio continued to fleece the childless couple with a bogus foreign property investment deal promising a return of up to £400,000. The conman is now starting a prison sentence for the scams which left Mr and Mrs Musselwhite devastated emotionally and financially. He told the couple he would use his contacts in Kenya to arrange for a mother to carry their child after they had failed to conceive. The couple handed over £6,000 before being told the baby was born disabled. A deal for a second baby was reached but DiCaprio extracted more money by saying the child was ill and there had been visa complications to delay its arrival. He even sent them fake pictures of the baby he called Amy, which he had actually taken from a photographer’s website. In a separate scam, DiCaprio persuaded Mr Musselwhite and his mother Doreen to invest £55,000 and £34,000 respectively in a fake property development in Kenya. Alexia Durran, prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, said that DiCaprio met the couple in a group for deaf people around 20 years ago and was considered a good friend. He discovered they were trying for a baby through his ex-wife and embarked on 'a sophisticated fraud' to convince them he could arrange a surrogate mother to give them the child they wanted. 'In June 2011 he arranged for Sonia to meet with a man known only as Carl, who said he could arrange the surrogate for them,' said Miss Durran. 'She took out a loan and paid £6,000 to DiCaprio who said he would pass it on to Carl, who never appeared again.' The couple were told a mother, named Melissa, had been found to carry their child. Alexia Durran, prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, said that DiCaprio met the couple in a group for deaf people around 20 years ago and was considered a good friend . 'Mr Musselwhite said DiCaprio attended the Oxford fertility clinic, where he appeared to speak with the receptionist, leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to Kenya.' DiCaprio told the couple this child was suffering from Down’s syndrome. 'The Musselwhites were upset at this news as they thought the child’s disability, combined with their own deafness, would mean they would be unable to communicate together,' said Miss Durran. DiCaprio told the couple, from Reading, Berkshire, they would have to pay for a second mother to be found and a further £6,000 pounds was handed over after he said a woman named Jenny Maghanga had agreed. 'He told them the baby had been called Amy and sent them photographs,' said Miss Durran. Mrs Musselwhite gave up her job in February 2013 to prepare for Amy’s arrival but DiCaprio repeatedly said complications had come up which required more money before she could come to England. 'They were told Amy had spina bifida and had to have an operation, that she was suffering with malaria and that there were difficulties with her visa,' said Miss Durran. A woman claiming to be Jenny Maghanga called Mr Musselwhite and demanded more money, as did DiCaprio, who said if it was not paid the baby would be given to someone else. Investigations found no paperwork documenting the transfer of eggs and sperm to Kenya, which is strictly regulated by fertility clinics and the photographs purporting to be Amy were in fact taken by a London photographer of his daughter and uploaded online. DiCaprio had already convinced Mr Musselwhite he was involved in a building project in Kenya which, once completed, would earn investors a large return. 'Mr Musselwhite was persuaded on three . occasions to remortgage his home and take out high-interest loans, to . the amount of £55,000,' said Miss Durran. In . 2007, Mr Musselwhite’s mother Doreen became concerned after finding out . his mortgage, which had originally been for £35,000, was then . for £143,000. After the scheme was explained to her, Doreen . attempted to find out what was happening between 2007 and 2008. In . 2011, DiCaprio emailed Mr Musselwhite telling him he would be receiving . £90,000 after seven Kenyan apartments were sold, in exchange for . £1,500 in legal fees. He showed his mother the email and . DiCaprio visited her in early 2012 to show her false documents claiming . rights to build and land ownership in the African country. Mr Musselwhite said DiCaprio attended the Oxford fertility clinic, where he appeared to speak with the receptionist, leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to Kenya . DiCaprio, from Rossendale, Lancashire, told Mr Musselwhite he would be paid a total of £400,000 and asked Doreen for £9,000 which would make her £105,000 in return. She paid the money and also agreed to a further £25,000 for an eventual return of £140,000. Neither Mr Musselwhite nor his mother has ever seen any return on their investments. DiCaprio was arrested on September 3, 2013, and admitted telling the Musselwhites he could arrange a surrogate mother and that the two children suffered the disabilities described, but said he had lost contact with ‘mother’ Jenny Maghanga. 'He described himself in relation to this operation as just being a mediator and denied he had kept any money given to him,' said Miss Durran. He told police he had several bank accounts in Kenya but could not provide details and claimed he had been sent the photographs by Jenny. The court heard he had 11 previous convictions for numerous offences dating back to 1982, including theft, forgery and making false statements. He was jailed for eight years in 1992 for robbing a jeweller while armed and for two years in 1999 for attempting to obtain property by deception. Rebecca Randall, mitigating, asked for leniency from Judge Reddihough as prison would be 'more onerous,' for DiCaprio due to his deafness - who accepted what he did was wrong. 'He has now shown some sympathy, empathy and understanding of the consequences of his actions on the Musselwhites.' The court heard DiCaprio was keen to pay compensation to his victims, and a Proceeds of Crime Act confiscation hearing is due to take place on June 13 at Reading Crown Court. Miss Randall said DiCaprio was born partially deaf but lost hearing in both ears in a hit-and-run accident in the early 1990s, which contributed to his offending as he lost his job and independence as a result of it. She added that he had been abused as a child and was only recently coming to terms with the idea it may have impacted on him. The court heard DiCaprio has a wife and six-year-old child, who is also deaf, living in Kenya. Judge Reddihough, sentencing, said: 'The evidence in this case demonstrates you are a devious liar and a scheming fraudsman. In relation to Mr and Mrs Musselwhite, you preyed on their emotions and the long-standing wish to have a child.' He added: 'Putting it shortly, in a despicable way you conned them out of large sums of money. 'All three victims have suffered substantial financial loses which they could ill afford and their victim impact statements indicate the worry, upset and anguish you have caused to them by the very serious breaches of trust.' DiCaprio, who wore a blue short-sleeved shirt and jeans, was sentenced to 18 months for two charges relating to the baby scam and two years for two charges relating to the property scheme, to run consecutively for a total of three and a half years. The Musselwhites declined to comment after the hearing.\n",

Star-crossed actor: Armand Assante, 64, appeared in court in an effort to save his Orange, County, New York, estate from foreclosure . Actor Armand Assante was in a New York court this week in a last-ditch attempt to save his rustic mansion from foreclosure. The 64-year-old star of the original 'Judge Dredd' appeared in the state Supreme Court in Goshen with his legal team Wednesday, asking a judge for a temporary restraining order to prevent his Campbell Hall horse farm from being auctioned off in May. Assante's attorney Tom Vlasti argued that the veteran film and TV star was the victim of mortgage fraud. While the Emmy-winning actor was filming in Romania in 2005, one of his financial advisers secured a $1.5million, 30-year mortgage on his behalf from Eastern Savings Bank in Maryland at nearly 10 per cent interest - a rate double the national average. According to the lawyer, the bank used fraudulent methods to increase the interest rate and turned down settlement offers because its goal all along was to seize the 7,000-square-foot rural estate worth $3.5million. Rustic elegance: Assante owns this sprawling horse farm that sits on 7,000 square feet of land in Campbell Hall worth $3.5million . Family man: Assante, 64, said in court that he had built the rustic home with his father, and he wants to leave it to his two daughters (right) ‘I wasn’t targeted because I’m a celebrity,’ Assante told the New York Post's Page Six. ‘I was targeted because I have an equity-rich property.’ 'The Odyssey' star, who declared bankruptcy in 2011, said he is determined to continue his nine-year battle to expose the bank's alleged malfeasance. Assante, a divorced father of two, said he had built the sprawling estate sitting on a large tract on land in Orange County, New York, with his late father, and he wants to leave it as a legacy to his two daughters, Anya and Alesandra. Assante’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing from 2011 stated that he owed $12,138 to the Screen Actors’ Guild’s credit union and $36,574 for unpaid taxes for 2006, 2007 and 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported. To add to the actor's apparent financial troubles, his former spouse of 12 years, Karen Assante, sued him in 2012 claiming that he owed her $1.8million in unpaid matrimonial support, according to The Record Online.

      "183. By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:21 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 7 March 2014 . An Arizona court has heard the voicemails that a former socialite left for her ex-boyfriend after she allegedly hired him to kill her ex-husband so that she could cash out on his $2million life insurance policy. Pamela Phillips is on trial for the murder of her ex-husband Gary Triano who was killed in 1996 after a pipe bomb exploded when he got into his car at a Tucson country club. State prosecutors have accused Phillips, now 56, of hiring her ex-boyfriend Ron Young to kill Triano. Young has already been found guilty and is serving two life sentences in jail but jurors were instructed not to consider that during Phillips' case. Her turn: After two weeks of listening to the prosecution, Pamela Phillips' defense team will be given the chance to explain why they believe she is not guilty for arranging the pipe bomb that killed her ex husband . She has pled not guilty to the charges, but the prosecutors ended the first two weeks of the trial by playing recordings that Young secretly taped of their conversations. 'I wanted to tell you thank you because you're a great friend...The other thing is... is it looks like the money is gone,' she says in one tape. Upset: On Thursday, the Arizona court heard recordings that Phillips' ex boyfriend Ron Young (pictured) made when he was calling her about payments for the bombing . 'I'm not able to send you more money, I mean, there's, you know we need to talk about this.' Even though Phillips and Triano, a real estate developer, were already divorced at the time of his death, she was still listed as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy so she was awarded $2million after the bombing. By that time, Phillips had moved to Aspen and was indulging in expensive trips so the prosecution alleges that she was not able to keep up with her monthly payments to her reported hit man. He became upset and began recording their phone conversations. In one recording that the court heard on Thursday, he tries to get her to admit her role but she brushes it off. 'You know what I'm just aggravated. Would you just leave me alone? Just leave me alone,' she is heard saying. 'Am I bothering you?' Young responds. 'Right now, you are. I've gotta go I've got kids down at the pool. I've got company at four-' 'Well you bothered me for some help so you could get rich, so,' he says. 'Will you leave me alone? Goodbye.' At no point in the recordings does she confess to having a role in the bombing. Her defense team revealed during the opening statements that they plan to show that she did not need to kill her husband because she had little to gain from the death of the father of her two children. Prosecutors presented a wildly . different theory of a woman who grew accustomed to the high life and . found herself struggling financially with an easy way out. Scene: The prosecution contends that while Phillips was not at the Tucson-area country club when her ex husband Gary Triano was killed in 1996, she paid Young to plant the bomb . 'There . is one reason that Gary Triano was murdered. One reason. He was . murdered because his death benefited Pamela Phillips in a big way - . $2million is a hell of a motive,' prosecutor Nicol Green said. On Monday, the trial will turn to her defense team and they are expected to take up to a month- double the amount of time that the prosecution needed- to make their case. Her attorneys have submitted a list of more than 100 possible witnesses who may be called to testify on her behalf. One of those witnesses is Ed Kinnear, the diplomat father of actor Greg Kinnear. Triano was a developer who made . millions investing in Indian bingo halls and slot-machine parlors in . Arizona and California before Congress authorized tribes to open . full-blown casinos. But after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests, Triano went broke. That's around the time Phillips filed for divorce, prosecutors say, because Triano could no longer support her expensive tastes. Back in the day: The prosecution has painted Phillips, seen left in an undated photo, as a gold digger who left her real estate developer husband Gary Triano (right) after he lost much of his fortune . In court: Phillips was arrested in Austria in 2009 and extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time (pictured on February 19) 'All of a sudden, the lifestyle that this defendant insisted on and expected was no longer there,' Green said. She . eventually moved to Aspen and worked in real estate before meeting . Young. The two would soon hatch a plan to kill Triano and collect on the . policy, Green said. 'They were talking about it for years,' Green said. Young later left Aspen while being investigated by police for fraud, and turned up in Tucson briefly in the summer of 1996. 'The reason he comes to Tucson was that he and Pamela Phillips had already agreed to kill Gary Triano,' Green said. After . the killing, Young was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in . Colorado on fraud charges while Phillips was sending him money for the . hit, eventually adding up to $400,000, Green told jurors. The . investigation into Triano's killing stalled until Young's arrest in . 2005. Authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial . transactions with Phillips, including recorded telephone conversations . and invoices. Police also found divorce records pertaining to . Phillips and Triano in a van rented by Young. That's when Young and . Phillips became the key suspects. She was arrested in Austria in 2009 and . extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was . mentally unfit to stand trial at the time.\n",
      "184. By . James  Nye . Convicted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff has said that he doesn't think he has got anything left to live for but refutes any suggestions that he purposely betrayed Jewish people in an interview given from his jail cell in North Carolina. Asked whether he was afraid of death, Madoff, 75, replied that he is not because it could never compare with being ostracized and rejected by his family for the shame he has brought them. The disgraced financier admitted his responsibility for the 2010 suicide of his son Mark, fighting back tears as he complained, 'The thing that was important to me was family, but that's all gone. That's more punishment than being incarcerated.' Defiant: Bernie Madoff has used a recent interview to unleash his opinions on politics and his enormous multi-billion dollar Ponzi fraud scheme . Madoff, who is serving 150-years in prison for operating a Ponzi scheme that is conservatively estimated to have stolen $18 billion, came clean to his wife Ruth and their children Mark and Andrew at the end of 2008. They turned him over to authorities, but the shame of his father's deception proved too much for Mark - who hung himself. 'I hold myself responsible for his suicide,' he said to Politico's MJ Lee. 'My grandchildren are without their father. That’s probably the worst.' Ruth, Andrew and Mark all have maintained that they were in the dark as to Madoff's enormous financial scams. For her part, Ruth has said that she regrets not cutting off ties with her husband of 54-years sooner - which her eldest son Mark requested before his death. Now she only communicates with Madoff about health issues - mainly his youngest son Andrew's battle with lymphoma. Madoff told Politico he believes in God and that he prays every day for the health of his family. He declined to talk about the last conversation he ever had with his wife, claiming only to understand his decision to distance herself from him. Madoff also turned his anger on Jude Denny Chin who sentenced him to 150-years for his 'extraordinary evil'. 'How do you give a 70-year-old man a 150-year sentence?' he asked. 'I think the judge is an idiot. For all intents and purposes, it’s a life sentence.' Indeed, it is Madoff's deception within New York's Jewish community which he sees as an unfair accusation too. Accepting responsibility: Police remove Mark Madoff's body from his apartment where he was found dead in New York on December 11, 2010 - in a recent interview his father accepted full responsibility for his son's death . Tragic: Mark Madoff and his wife Stephanie - his father Bernie Madoff admitted in a recent interview that the suicide of his son was all his fault and that the shame he has heaped on his family is the regret of his life . He was well known within Jewish circles in the Big Apple and his fraud hit many charities and individuals he knew for years. 'The thing that was important to me was family, but that's all gone. That's more punishment than being incarcerated.' - Bernie Madoff laments his multi-billion dollar fraud . However, during the course of the Politico interview he became annoyed at the suggestion that he singled out any particular group. 'I don’t feel any worse for a Jewish person than I do for a Catholic person,' he said. 'Religion had nothing to do with it.' 'I don’t feel that I betrayed the Jews, I betrayed people,' before adding, 'I betrayed people that put trust in me — certainly the Jewish community. I’ve made more money for Jewish people and charities than I’ve lost.' During the course of the rare interview given at Butner, North Carolina, Madoff boasts that he 'has freedom to move about the compound, where the cells are not locked at night.' He even goes as far to claim the prison is 'actually very pretty' and 'more like a college campus. Everything's provided for you.' Rejected: Bernie Madoff said that since his wife, Ruth (pictured) cut him off along with his surviving son Andrew- his life has lost all meaning . Dead to him: Andrew Madoff no longer speaks to his father Bernie Madoff - a move which has left the Ponzi schemer struggling to find meaning in his life . Madoff even makes the claim that he never wanted his deception to go as far as it eventually did. He said that losses he suffered in the early 1990s led to the Ponzi scheme in an effort to reduce the damage. He said he 'wishes people could understand' it was never his intention to deceive his clients for so long. 'I’d like to believe that there was something mentally wrong with me. It would make me feel better.' - Bernie Madofff on his weekly visits to a psychiatrist . 'I don’t believe I’m a bad person. I did a lot of good for people. I made huge sums of money for some people,' he said. 'It wasn’t just for money. I already had huge amounts of money. It wasn’t to buy yachts or homes. I had that from the beginning from legitimate money I made.' He added, 'There’s nothing to repent for. I already knew what I did was wrong.' Ominously, Madoff also claims that he is convinced there is almost certainly another Ponzi swindler out there. 'There’s always going to be bad players like myself,' he said to Politico. He also attacks politicians such as President Obama,  Hillary Clinton, Senator Chuck Schumer, Jersey Governor Chris Christie and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. He claims to have grown weary of their 'never ending' requests for cash for campaigns when he was still thought to be wealthy. 'These politicians take money from anybody — Democrats, Republicans,' he said in what is his fifth interview since being jailed in 2009. 'I basically think everybody would be better off… if people weren’t able to exert so much influence on politicians with money.' No big fan: Bernie Madoff said that he thinks the Hilary Clinton will make a terrible president and would not have voted for President Obama in 2012 because he is too socialist . Madoff claims that he voted for Obama in 2008, but now believes he is 'terribly disappointed' in the president and would not have voted for him a second time. 'His policies are too socialist.' Warming to this theme he attacks New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, claiming, 'I’m not a great fan of redistribution of wealth,' Madoff says. The fraudster also claimed he doesn’t think Hillary would make a good president. 'I certainly wasn’t impressed with her as secretary of state. Our foreign policy is a mess,' he said. Politico points out that it wasn't that long ago that Madoff lived in a $10 million duplex penthouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and had access to a private jet and 55-foot restored yacht. Now, he rises at 4am and is in bed by 8pm. He passes the time by reading and watches hours of television and listens to radio news. Loss of luxury: The apartment building that wasthe home of accused swindler Bernard Madoff on New York City's upper east side . He says the food is alright but he reserves special disdain for the chicken fried race at Butner, which is in his opinion, 'horrible.' Madoff makes about $40 per month keeping the living quarters clean as part of a five-inmate crew. He refutes the recent reports that he has kidney cancer, but does admit that he has a form of kidney disease that is under control. He says his recent heart attack was caused by a blocked artery but that he has had a stent put in place to correct it. 'I’m on so much medication — heart, kidney blood pressure,' he said. 'I never took a pill before I came here. Anxiety medication. I must take 14 different meds every day.' He also visits a psychiatrist once a week - for all the good he says it does him. 'I can’t tell you how many hours I’ve spent with the psychiatrist — to try to make some sort of peace with myself, to understand how I did it,' he said. 'I’d like to believe that there was something mentally wrong with me. It would make me feel better.' Madoff said he dreams of living a different life. 'I would go find myself an island somewhere with my wife, if she were willing to, and go fishing.' But he’s not sure Ruth would go with him. 'I don’t know. I would hope so.'\n",
      "185. By . Chris Pleasance . David Reid, 50, has been jailed for six years after admitting conning friends and vulnerable people out of £3.5million . A 'cold-hearted' conman who lived the high-life on cash taken from vulnerable investors in a £3.5million fraud has been jailed. David Reid splashed out on fast cars, a boat, spent thousands on restaurants and hotels, took foreign ski holidays and funded his shooting hobby using money from friends who trusted him with their savings. Newcastle Crown Court heard that, in one case, a little boy with special needs lost out on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Disney Land when he family were conned. In total Reid, who posed as a solicitor and former Olympic shooter, conned 50 victims who lost their homes, life savings, and pensions through the Washington Mortgage Company. Judge James Goss QC yesterday sentenced the 50-year-old, who claimed to be a Labour party member, to six years behind bars. The judge told him: 'This involves over £3.5million which was spent on good living. 'Many offences were committed against older and entirely trusting, decent people, some of whom in vulnerable situations by reason of ill health or other circumstances including bereavement. 'They were cruelly deceived by your false veneer of professionalism and reassurances. They have suffered financially, some ruinously, and emotionally. 'Personal statements reveal the devastating consequences for them and their families of your gross breaches of trust.' Reid was described by one of his victims as a 'very clever and affable' man who wore Saville Row suits and would impress potential investors with £10,000 parties at his home, where fairground rides and clay pigeon shooting would be put on for the guests. Prosecutor David Dixon told the court: 'He was a plausible conman for a period in excess of 10 years, obtaining funds from people who knew him, were referred to him and who had been to his business premises in the Galleries. 'He set up a carefully crafted, professionally operated fraud.' The court heard Reid used forged documents to convince his clients their money was invested safely in offs-shore accounts through the Abbey National and later Santander. When his scam was uncovered by a client he duped in 2003 the police were informed yet no prosecution followed and he continued to trade. Reid hosted £10,000 parties at his house for investors with fairground rides and clay pigeon shooting to make them feel secure, while actually spending their cash on cars, a boat, luxury hotels and fine dining . The court heard many of his victims had considered themselves friends of the fraudster and found they had lost everything through listening to his advice. Mr Dixon added: 'The crown say it was particularly cold-hearted, he was callous in the way he offended. 'It was a clear case of greed. He spent £1,000 on dog bills, £11,500 on skiing holidays, £14, 000 on restaurants and hotels, £6,000 on shooting and £55,000 to pay off credit cards. 'Over the years he has had the benefit of nice cars including Mercedes Benz, a Range Rover, Audi and at one stage had a boat. 'It is difficult to say where all the money has gone. Very little, if any, will remain.' The court heard one widower lost £300,000 his late wife had left as an inheritance for her family's future. Trevor Lazaro, 50, from County Durham, turned to Reid, who he had thought was a friend, to help with financial affairs when his wife Linda lost her battle with cancer. Widower Lazaro, of Burnhope, County Durham, described how Reid groomed his family for several years, knowing that his wife Linda has cancer - and that she had a large insurance policy of £300,000. As a result of taking the conman's advice Mr Lazario, who has a child with downs syndrome, has been forced to put the family home on the market. He said: 'The defendant has stolen my family money, stolen my future and my children's futures, as well as make a fool out of me and our friendship. 'Most of the money was left for the long-term care of my eldest daughter, who has Down's syndrome. That is gone now. 'He never had the common decency to come and apologise. He appears to show no remorse whatsoever for his actions. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Reid's 50 victims lost their homes, life savings and pensions and in one case a boy with down's syndrome missed out on a once-of-a-lifetime trip to Disney Land when his parents were duped . 'He is nothing more than a common thief, preying on the sick and the vulnerable.'Another victim who said Reid had given a eulogy at her late husband's funeral and helped her sort out financial necessities while she was grieving. She later realised he had conned her out of more than £30,000. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it was like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. 'I felt totally lost, like a bereavement all over again. My husband went to his grave thinking I was financially set for the rest of my life. 'I have no trust left in anyone anymore.' The court heard Reid confessed during police interviews there were more than 50 victims. Some payments were made from the accounts but a total loss of more than £1.6million remains outstanding and is unlikely to be recovered. Jamie Adams, defending, said Reid is 'sorry' for what he did and had not set out deliberately to make people lose money. Mr Adams said Reid has tried to kill himself twice and feels real shame and remorse for what he has done. He added: 'He was not setting out for people to lose money, that was not the objective here. 'He became over-confident and thought he could play the system. He was playing the markets because he had large sums of money available to him.

Karl Swift, 25, pretended he had been robbed at knife-point at the William Hill bookmakers where he worked in Goose Green, Wigan after he gambled £2,084 away at a casino. But CCTV footage was examined and showed Swift alone in the betting shop and bending down behind the counter to switch off the security cameras. Karl Swift, 25, faked a robbery at the William Hill where he worked in Wigan after getting into 'desperate financial straits' He said he was 'desperate financial straits' and had only become addicted to gambling after starting work in the betting industry four years earlier. At Liverpool Crown Court this week, Swift, from Orrell, near Wigan pleaded guilty to theft, fraud and attempting to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for 12 months. He has been attending counselling sessions with Gamblers Anonymous, the court heard. Police were called in last September after duty manager Swift falsely claimed that he had been held up at knife-point just after he arrived at the William Hill bookie’s. Swift, from Orrell, near Wigan, said he had only become addicted to gambling after starting work in the betting industry four years earlier . Swift claimed there had been an armed robbery at the William Hill in Goose Green, Wigan. But CCTV showed he was there alone . He said £5,744 was taken and claimed the 'raider' had turned off the shop’s CCTV system and had broken into the safe. But, as well as the incriminating CCTV footage, Swift’s boss saw an unusual sequence of 31 bets the previous day totaling £3,660. Further inquiries revealed Swift himself had placed those bets - of which only seven were successful - and the stakes and not been paid for. In mitigation, defence lawyer Martyn Walsh said Swift was described as 'good worker' but had lost £2,084 in a casino. Mr Walsh added: 'He was a very desperate man who had reached the end of the road.' Judge, Mr Recorder Roderick Carus QC, told him: 'These were were serious offences and you were in a position of trust. You have lost your reputation, your job and now your liberty.'\n",
      "187. By . Emma Glanfield . Marc Burnett, 30, from Preston, East Yorkshire, swindled £226,508 in 45 false transactions while working as a senior banking advisor at Lloyds Bank . A senior financial advisor has walked free from court despite stealing more than £200,000 from the life savings of six pensioners and blowing it all on football bets. Marc Burnett, 30, a senior banking advisor for Lloyds Bank, used standing orders to siphon money from the unknowing pensioners’ accounts into ones he 'controlled'. Burnett, of Preston, East Yorkshire, stole £226,508 in 45 false transactions between 2008 and 2013 to fund his gambling habit - which started when he was just ten-years-old. Hull Crown Court heard how he ensured his elderly victim’s did not find out about his swindling by diverting their bank statements. Burnett’s bosses at Lloyds Bank were also duped by his behaviour and the court heard how his senior managers knew nothing of his withdrawals. Phillips Evans, prosecuting, said Burnett came across as ‘charming and polite’ to his victims despite swindling them for their life savings behind their backs. He said: ‘The accounts he stole money from were not randomly selected from the computer. ‘They were people Mr Burnett met face to face or on the telephone and then swindled them of their life saving. ‘He targeted six customer accounts. One has since died and the other cannot be found. They approached him for financial advice and they trusted him with their life savings.’ Burnett, who served in the RAF when he was younger, pleaded guilty to six charges of fraud after his swindling was uncovered by bosses while he was on a two-week holiday in June last year. Defence barrister Anil Murray said his gambling spiralled out of control after winning £1,800 from a £10 bet when he was 21. He said: ‘In his early 20s he had a flat of his own in the town and he would gamble online on football. ‘He started working for Lloyds and his addiction became worse spending all of his money as soon as he got paid. ‘He started putting bigger and bigger bets on with the aim of winning big. The aim was to repay his debts, but of course the win never came. He would put between £150 and £4,000 on and it spiralled. ‘He lost his flat. He could not see a way out of the debt and began stealing. His thinking was distorted. He became low and depressed. He knew he would be caught.’ Hull Crown Court, pictured, heard how Burnett, of Preston, Lancashire, stole £226,508 in 45 false transactions between 2008 and 2013 to fund his gambling habit . He said Burnett had since split up with his girlfriend and moved back in with his mother and is now attending a gambling anonymous group after last placing a bet on February 8. In a statement read out in court, victim Paul Barron told how he felt ‘betrayed’ by the fraudster. He said: ‘My trust had been completely breached. What made it worse was he advised me to close my accounts with other banks and pool all my money with Lloyds.’ Fellow victim Mary Orvis said: ‘He was a nice smart, young fellow. I felt he had targeted me.’ And Alan Shippey, who was also targeted by Burnett, said: ‘I placed my trust in the bank to look after my finances. I’m angry about what he has done.’ Lloyds Bank dismissed Burnett when the fraudulent behaviour came to light and the firm has since refunded all of the money back to his victims. Sentencing, Recorder Jonathan Carroll told Burnett: ‘What you have done drives a dagger into the heart of the banking system and the trust that people must feel in their banks. ‘Their rewards for hard work in life must be saved. These people saw you as a charming young man. ‘In your case you made unauthorised standing orders, closed down account and moved money to your own all to fund your gambling addiction. It is an addiction you have to tackle. ‘I have thought long and hard about whether I can suspend your sentence of two years imprisonment. ‘It is clear you are remorseful, not just to the bank, but also to the customers you stole from.’ He added: 'It cannot be said this was out of character because you have been gambling for 10 years. Your family are distraught at your behaviour which is understandable because you are a gambling thief.' Lloyds Bank declined to say which branch Burnett worked at but said in a statement: 'We take our customers' security very seriously and work closely with the police to combat fraud.'In this case, the fraud was swiftly identified by the bank and we notified the police and the relevant authorities and assisted fully in their investigation.' Burnett was handed a two year suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work.\n",
      "188. By . Harriet Arkell . Green entrepreneur David Green, 52, hanged himself at his home on the Isle of Wight after he was arrested over false allegations of fraud, an inquest heard today . A green entrepreneur hanged himself after he was arrested over false allegations he had pocketed £115,000 of taxpayers' cash, an inquest heard. Keen yachtsman David Green, 52, left a note criticising police who arrested him on suspicion of fraud before he took his own life in the grounds of his family's eco-home outside Cowes on the Isle of Wight, the hearing was told. The award-winning businessman, who 'aimed to turn the Isle of Wight green' with his self-sufficiency firm, Ecoisland, was devastated after news of his arrest was leaked to the local paper. But the inquest in Newport heard charges would never have been brought against the father of two, as the arrest was based upon a misreading of financial documents by an employee at Isle of Wight Council. The court was told that Mr Green was assumed to have pocketed £115,000 of 'green grants' after council workers found the sum was unaccounted for after Ecoisland collapsed. Instead, it emerged that the cash had simply been swallowed up in the running costs of his ambitious eco venture, designed to make the island self-sufficient. Mr Green's widow, Patricia, 59, told a coroner how her husband was 'devastated' after being arrested on 3 October last year. She said: 'David had described the experience as the most humiliating and degrading in his whole life. 'He was a very honest and honourable man, so the thought of being questioned, and hearing someone at the police station call him \"the prisoner\" hit him hard.' Mr Green had told . interviewing officers 'I’m finished' after he was arrested and quizzed . for three hours at Newport Police Station, the . inquest heard. Describing her husband as a 'proud man who had achieved so much in his life', Mrs Green added: 'The day after David was arrested, the story was on the front page of the County Press... 'It just threw him.  He said \"I'm not going to be able to walk down the road, I'm going to be a pariah.\"' She said she found her husband hanging in the grounds of their house as she returned from a walk with a friend on 7 October. Award-winning eco-entrepreneur Mr Green pictured receiving a sustainability prize from Caroline Lucas MP . Mr Green, pictured outside his house near Cowes, won awards for making his family home so eco-friendly . Mr Green left a lengthy suicide note condemning the detectives who had questioned him. He wrote: 'They clearly did not believe a word I said and treated me like a criminal. No compassion or innocence before guilt there, I’m afraid.' Mr Green, who was chief executive of the UK Sailing Association for 20 years, had won numerous awards after converting his large family home near Cowes into the most eco-friendly property on the island. He launched the Ecoisland Community Interest Company to make the Isle of Wight the first self-sustainable region in the UK, and the venture was backed by industry heavyweights including Cable and Wireless, IBM and Toshiba. Isle of Wight Council also gave him £240,000 of a Government cash grant towards the scheme. However, . the business ran into financial difficulties and went into . administration in late September last year, prompting the Greens to . decide to sell their home and 'start again', the inquest heard. Ambitious: Mr Green aimed to make the Isle of Wight self-sufficient with his green Ecoisland venture . The following week, Isle of Wight Council told police that £115,000 of government funding was unaccounted for - a conclusion they reached after going through Ecoisland financial spreadsheets. But Detective Constable Lee Stewart, of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Police fraud unit, told the inquest: 'The money had simply been swallowed up in the money problems of the organisation.  There is nothing to suggest it was fraudulently obtained.' He added: 'The factually incorrect spreadsheet - as perceived by the council - was in fact a misinterpretation of the material.' 'Mr Green was a decent man who had some financial problems, but there is no evidence... of dishonesty and that is the thing he would have struggled with most' Coroner Caroline Sumeray . Caroline Sumeray, the senior coroner for the Isle of Wight, recorded a verdict of suicide and told the hearing in Newport: 'I’m very sorry to hear the sad tale behind this case.' Speaking to Mrs Green and her younger child, Luke, 29, the coroner said it was 'horrendous' for them discover Mr Green 'felt driven to this by the humiliation he felt because he was arrested, because he was interviewed, because of the allegation that was made that was incorrect, false, inaccurate.' She added: 'I can’t begin to imagine how you are feeling.' The coroner said the police had acted 'properly' in investigating Mr Green following the allegation made by Isle of Wight Council, but criticised the council for releasing news of the arrest to the local newspaper prematurely. 'I trust there will be a full investigation and appropriate action taken against whoever provided this information,' said Mrs Sumeray. She added that Mr Green was 'a decent man who had some financial problems - but there is no evidence on the papers of dishonesty and that is the thing he would have struggled with most.'

      "189. By . Associated Press . A once-prominent socialite was found guilty Tuesday in the 1996 Tucson car bomb killing of her ex-husband after spending years abroad living a lavish lifestyle across Europe. Pamela Phillips, 56, had pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. During the trial that began in February, Phillips' lawyers told jurors their client had nothing to gain from the death of businessman Gary Triano and that she was the victim of overzealous authorities who failed to follow other leads. They said Phillips was already a successful real estate broker with her own money, and suggested that Triano had numerous other enemies. Guilty: Pamela Phillips, shown as her verdict was handed down on Tuesday, has been found guilty on Tuesday of murder in the explosive death of her ex-husband Gary Triano . Haunting past: Phillips smirks as the verdict settles in on Tuesday in a Tuscon, Arizona court . But prosecutors described Phillips as a gold digger who hired a former boyfriend to kill Triano to collect on a $2million life insurance policy in order to maintain her extravagant taste for the good life. It's been nearly two decades since Triano died when his car exploded as he was leaving a Tucson-area country club after playing golf. Authorities said Phillips paid ex-boyfriend Ronald Young $400,000 to carry out the hit. Young was convicted in 2010 and sentenced to two life terms in prison, but jurors weren't allowed to consider his case while determining Phillips' fate. 'The state went after the easy marks,' defense attorney Paul Eckerstrom told jurors during closing arguments, indicating that Triano had plenty of other enemies with better motives to kill him. 'You have to tell the state: \"You made a mistake.\"' Prosecutors presented a portrait of a . woman who grew accustomed to the high life and found herself struggling . financially with an easy $2million way out. The . state's case against her hinged largely on the purported secret . arrangement between Phillips and Young, who the defendant dated while . working as a real estate broker in Aspen, Colo., after she divorced . Triano. While . Phillips claimed she had paid Young the $400,000 for assistance with . business ventures and financial planning, prosecutors argued the money . was clearly payment for the hit. Scene: The prosecution contends that while Phillips was not at the Tucson-area country club when her ex husband Gary Triano was killed in 1996, she paid Young to plant the bomb . Plot: Phillips had entered a plea of not guilty but jurors were convinced by voicemails she left for her ex-boyfriend-turned-hitman who was convicted in 2010 (seen in court last week) 'He's not getting paid for business . advice that she never takes â€” he's getting paid for murder,' prosecutor . Rick Unklesbay said in closing arguments. During . the trial, in addition to witnesses, prosecutors used financial records . and telephone conversations that Young secretly recorded during talks . with Phillips. In one recording, Young appears to grow angry over not . receiving his payments, telling Phillips, 'You're going to be in a . woman's prison for murder.' Defense lawyers said the calls were merely the ramblings of a con man. One prosecution witness, a longtime friend of Phillips, testified that Phillips once told her how easy it would be to hire someone to kill her husband. Back in the day: The prosecution painted . Phillips, seen left in an undated photo, as a gold digger who left her . real estate developer husband Gary Triano (right) after he lost much of . his fortune . The defense downplayed the testimony, noting Phillips was distraught at the time after having a fight with Triano during which he threatened her. Phillips' lawyers also called into question the witness' memory. Triano was a developer who made millions investing in Indian bingo halls and slot-machine parlors in Arizona and California before Congress authorized tribes to open full-blown casinos. But after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests, Triano went broke. Upset: On Thursday, the Arizona court heard recordings that Phillips' ex boyfriend Ron Young (pictured) made when he was calling her about payments for the bombing . That's around the time Phillips filed for divorce, prosecutors said. The couple, who had two children together, separated, but Phillips remained the beneficiary of Triano's insurance policy, paying the premiums herself. She eventually moved to Aspen and worked in real estate before meeting Young, and prosecutors said the two would later hatch a plan to kill Triano and collect on the policy. After the killing, Young was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in Colorado on fraud charges while Phillips was sending him money for the hit, eventually adding up to $400,000, prosecutors told jurors. The investigation into Triano's killing stalled until Young's arrest in 2005 in Florida on the fraud charges. That's when both Phillips and Young became the key suspects in the killing. Authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial transactions with Phillips, including recorded telephone conversations and invoices. Prosecutors said police also found divorce records pertaining to Phillips and Triano in a van rented by Young. By then, Phillips had received the $2 million insurance payout and had left Aspen for a life overseas.She was arrested in Austria in 2009 and extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time. Phillips' attorneys argued throughout the trial that the evidence against her was flimsy, and that Phillips was already wealthy with her own money. They said Young didn't even kill Triano, raising the specter that it could have been a hit by a jilted investor. Jurors began deliberating last week. Sentencing has been set for May 22, and Phillips faces life in prison.\n",

      "191. By . Andrew  Malone . With the door to the steam room shut at his Ascot home, Boris Berezovsky liked to retreat from the stresses of being a sworn enemy of Vladimir Putin, the former KGB man he bankrolled to become Russia’s president. But it was in this sanctuary that his body was found on Saturday, a discovery that has started a firestorm of suspicion about the manner of his death. Once such good friends that Berezovsky spent millions creating a political party for Putin, the pair fell out spectacularly in 2000, prompting the Russian leader’s supposed ‘godfather’ to flee to Britain. Unanswered questions: Boris Berezovsky's body was found at his estate in Ascot on Saturday, a discovery that has started a firestorm of suspicion about the manner of his death . Suggestions that Berezovsky, pictured with his former girlfriend Elena Gorbunova and their dog, Sim, had committed suicide were being treated with scepticism by the billionaire's friends and business associates . Yet even after escaping Moscow and moving into the former home of TV star Chris Evans, replete with hi-tech security systems as well as underground car parking, sauna and swimming pool, Berezovsky did not feel safe. Surrounded by teams of Russian security men, and with a personal bodyguard alongside him 24 hours a day, he was convinced his Kremlin enemies would track him down and kill him, even after he moved two years ago to a new property in Berkshire. Yesterday, suggestions that Berezovsky had committed suicide – as reported widely by the Russian media – were being treated with scepticism by the billionaire’s friends and business associates. ‘Boris was a fighter, and suicide was just not in his DNA,’ said Dr Yuri Felshtinsky, a close friend. 'Boris was looking to the future and did not seem to be suicidal. We spoke about his daughter. ‘Boris feared for his safety, and understood that the Kremlin aimed to destroy him as an example for anyone else who opposed them. He understood the Kremlin mindset better than anyone.’ Andrei Sidelnikov, a Berezovsky supporter given political asylum by Britain for his opposition to Putin, was emphatic. ‘Such a person could never commit suicide,’ he said. ‘He was an exceptionally lively person and, despite his various setbacks in life, always remained so.’ The discovery of Berezovsky's body comes five years after the unexplained death of another billionaire, Badri Patarkatsishvili (pictured), who he joined forces with to put Putin into power . Demyan Kudryavtsev, another Russian emigre and friend of the dead billionaire, also dismissed speculation that Berezovsky had killed himself: ‘No, it’s wrong. There are no exterior signs of suicide, no traces of a syringe, no signs that he could have taken some pills.’ Even more disturbing, the discovery of Berezovsky’s body comes five years after the unexplained death of another billionaire he joined forces with to put Putin into power – and who also later fell out spectacularly with the Russian leader. Badri Patarkatsishvili, a businessman and politician, was found dead at the Surrey mansion he owned, not far from Berezovsky’s former home, in 2008. Police, who initially described the death as ‘suspicious’, tested for radiation poisoning, but no traces were found. Along with Berezovsky, the dead man had helped bankroll Putin’s rise to the Kremlin, but had later clashed with associates of the country’s president as rival sides battled for control of Russia’s assets. No doubt: Berezovsky was hated in the Kremlin . Shortly before his death, the 52-year-old had spoken of an assassination plot, claiming that a hit squad of four Georgians had been sent by the Kremlin to London ‘to do something against me’, while secret tapes of a conversation between a Russian official and a Chechen hitman emerged in which they discussed how to make him ‘disappear completely’. Experts say that, as well as deadly substances such as ricin and polonium, a favoured method for despatching enemies of Russia is poisoning with sodium fluoroacetate, a chemical used in pesticides that causes heart failure when ingested in tiny amounts, with the cause of death notoriously difficult to establish. If Patarkatsishvili was assassinated, could the long arm of the Russian leadership have reached out to an enemy in the Home Counties again? There is no doubt Berezovsky was hated in the Kremlin. Yet it would be a grim end indeed for a man who was once a model Soviet citizen. Born in Moscow in 1946 to a Jewish civil engineer father and housewife mother, he was studious at school and sufficiently gifted at mathematics to join the Soviet Union’s Academy of Sciences. But the collapse of communism helped propel him from academia to the pinnacle of one of the most ruthless and violent business environments on Earth: post-Soviet Russia. As the Soviet empire crumbled and gang wars erupted, Berezovsky decided to go into business and forged a relationship with AvtoVAZ, producer of the Lada car. To protect his fortune, Berezovsky forged ties with Chechen gangsters – some of the most feared people in Russia. The graveyards of Russia are full of dead businessmen from the 1990s, and Berezovsky almost joined them: he faced a gun battle in central Moscow in 1994, and a year later the Mercedes he was in was blown up, decapitating his driver. But with nerves of steel, Berezovsky went for broke: he paid for the publication of President Boris Yeltsin’s memoirs, securing him the goodwill of Russia’s then leader. The political clout this gave him offered access to the national airline Aeroflot, and then to Russia’s massive oil reserves. Rewarded with a seat on Yeltsin’s national Security Council, he helped implement the peace deal that ended Russia’s first war with rebels in the Chechnya region, and was seen as a figure of almost Rasputin-like influence. To protect his fortune, Berezovsky forged ties with Chechen gangsters - some of the most feared people in Russia (police pictured at a road block near to where it is believed Boris Berezovsky died in Ascot) As Yeltsin’s health deteriorated in 1999 and his popularity plummeted, Berezovsky and others began to look for a protege who could rule Russia for its second post-Soviet decade. The obscure former KGB spy they found was Putin, who was officially approved by the powerbrokers of Russia during talks at their dachas around Moscow. ‘He presented [Putin] to the Russian establishment of that time, brought him into Boris Yeltsin’s close circle, and he was the first to believe that out of this indistinct bureaucrat, a successor could be made,’ said commentator Sergei Parkhomenko. ‘He was certainly the political father of Vladimir Putin.’ Yet, after he came to power backed by Berezovsky’s cash, Putin became irritated with the demands of his sponsor, who once said: ‘Everything can be bought and everything on Earth has a price. Politicians are the hired help of entrepreneurs.’ Last year Berezovsky suffered a devastating financial setback when he lost a legal battle with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich (pictured) This was an affront to Putin, a proud, self-proclaimed strongman who did not like anyone having power over him. His response was characteristically uncompromising, and after a series of death threats Berezovsky fled. Since Britain rebuffed Putin’s calls for Berezovsky to be extradited, the Kremlin has been busy preparing case after case against him in absentia – with ‘crimes’ allegedly ranging from massive fraud to murder. Undeterred, Berezovsky used his British base to vow to overthrow Putin. He joined forces with other exiles to implicate the Russian state in killings. But last year he suffered a devastating financial setback when he lost a legal battle with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Berezovsky wanted £4billion from Abramovich, whom he accused of using the threat of Kremlin retribution to intimidate him into selling shares at a knockdown price. Some say Berezovsky had struggled to come to come to terms with losing the case, in which legal costs hit £100million. Clearly shaken by the verdict in August, Berezovsky said it appeared to have been written by Putin himself. ‘Life is life,’ he sighed, before being driven off in a black Mercedes with tinted windows. Those who believe he died either of natural causes or at his own hand point to his dramatic loss of capital in recent times. His fortune, once estimated at £2billion, was running out, partly because he had spent years fighting a losing battle against Kremlin attempts to seize his assets. He was forced to sell his £200million yacht, and closed his political foundation, which had waged a public relations war against Putin, highlighting corruption and political killings linked to the KGB. He was also reeling from one of Britain’s biggest-ever divorce settlements, to his former wife Galina in 2011, to whom he paid more than £60million. Known for his love of cognac and beautiful women, Berezovsky was married three times and was a notorious womaniser. But lately one friend claimed he had been depressed by the loss of his wealth and was not himself. ‘We will learn later what exactly happened, but in recent months Boris was depressed,’ said Alex Goldfarb. ‘There was no secret about that. The court case was a massive blow. He was depressed. We were concerned about him.’ That concern was not shared by his enemies in the Kremlin. While an official spokesman claimed yesterday that Berezovsky had written to Putin this year to apologise, and begged to come home, his friends said this was merely Soviet-style propaganda. Indeed, he would have faced years in prison had he returned. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: Boris Berezovsky will never criticise the Kremlin again, and that is just the way Vladimir Putin will like it.\n",
      "192. By . Mark Duell . Financial advisor: Stephen Evans, 30, of Warrington, was running a Ponzi scheme to make himself rich . A CROOKED financial adviser dubbed the ‘Wolf of Old Hall Street’ bought a fleet of supercars, invested in a racehorse and even sponsored football clubs with the proceeds of a £4.4million Ponzi scheme. Conman Stephen Evans spent £1.5million snapping up so many top-of-the-range cars a judge said they would fill several episodes of Top Gear. Evans also splashed out £36,000 on yachts and £300,000 on jewellery, and paid £250,000 for a racehorse he renamed ‘Fat Gary’. His case echoes that of 1990s fraudster Jordan Belfort, who conned investors in the US and was the inspiration for The Wolf of Wall Street film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Over three years Evans, 30, enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with other people’s money. He bought an astonishing fleet of 20 luxury cars, including a lime green Lamborghini and a Porsche 911 for his girlfriend as well as BMWs and Mercedes. He ran his empire from Old Hall Street in Liverpool’s business district, but his reach stretched as far as the United Arab Emirates, where he recruited many of his victims. He used more than £250,000 of ill-gotten cash to buy corporate sponsorship deals at Liverpool and Everton football clubs and was even pictured with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. And after spending some £250,000 buying a racehorse called Saphir River, which he renamed Fat Gary, he shelled out £50,000 in stabling fees and handed a further £15,000 to Chester Racecourse to sponsor a race under the Fat Gary banner. Then there was £280,000 on flights, hotels, chauffeurs and other travel expenses, including £90,000 at Hilton hotels, £70,000 on Emirates international flights and £21,000 at The Ritz in London. On top of that, he spent £36,600 on two yachts for a staff trip to the Isle of Wight. He also rented properties at exclusive addresses and dressed himself in designer clothing and handmade bespoke suits. Evans also used other people’s money to give generously to charity, including £59,050 to the Marina Dalglish cancer appeal and £52,000 to the charity of Liverpool celebrity hairdresser Herbert Howe. Purchase: Among the cars Evans bought were a £190,000 Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera (pictured inside) Car collection: The fraudster also bought a Porsche 911 for £75,000, among many other vehicles . Plush accommodation: Evans spent £150,000 over three years renting accommodation at prestigious addreses, including Ye Priory Court in Allerton, Merseyside (pictured) Anfield: He put £45,000 towards sponsoring Liverpool FC and was photographed with player Steven Gerrard . Andrew West, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court: ‘In short, the case against Stephen Evans is that he ran what is commonly known as a Ponzi scheme. ‘Between 2007 and 2010 Evans worked as a stockbroker and financial adviser for Globaleye Investment and One International in the United Arab Emirates. ‘He then set up his own company, Stephen Evans Investments Ltd. During this time he continued living in Dubai and the Isle of Man for tax purposes.’ Welsh interest: Evans spent £10,000 on sponsorship of the Millennium Stadium (pictured) in Cardiff . Sponsorship: He put £15,000 to Chester Racecourse to sponsor a race under the Fat Gary banner. He had paid £250,000 for a race horse called Saphir River which he renamed Fat Gary . Expensive tastes: Evans, who was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court, spent £21,000 visiting The Ritz (pictured) Top class: He also visited Atlantis on the Palm Hotel (pictured), in Dubai, which came in at £19,500 . It was when Evans set up his own . company that the scams started. He persuaded clients to hand over large . amounts of cash which he claimed would be invested but which he simply . spent – and then sought new investors to repay what he owed the old . ones. In total, he took in . around £4.4million, of which £300,000 was paid to his initial investors . to keep the scam going. Later arrivals, including one man who gave him . £3.7million, received nothing back at all. It was, as Judge Denis . Watson, QC, said, ‘doomed to fail’. Life of luxury: The court heard Evans wrongly took around £4.4million by persuading clients to hand over cash he said would be invested into the business . Movie: His scam echoes the exploits of Jordan Belfort who was the inspiration for Oscar-nominated film The Wolf of Wall Street starring Leonardo DiCaprio (pictured) and Jonah Hill . Abroad: An image from Evans's trip to Queenstown, New Zealand. He spent £185,000 travelling to the country and socialising with his brother there . By the end of 2012 Evans was being . tracked by a private detective hired by one of his clients and gave . himself up to police in St Helens. Mr West said: ‘The hounds were at his heels, the game was up.’ Named . after one of the most notorious conmen in US history, the Ponzi scheme . is an elaborate version of the oldest scam of them all - pyramid . selling. In its . classic form, a Ponzi fraudster sets up a fund with a 'fail-safe' business plan. Investors join in their droves, lured by the huge returns . on offer. But the . fraudster will merely pay off old investors with new money that comes . into the fund. Eventually, all Ponzi schemes are doomed to collapse . under the weight of new money flooding in. The . fraud was named after Charles Ponzi, an Italian who emigrated to . America in 1903 with $2.50 in his pocket. After a spell in prison for . fraud, he set up an investment scheme to exploit differences in the . price of postage stamps in Italy and the U.S. At . the height of his success in 1920, Ponzi was making $250,000 a day - a . mammoth sum for the era. When his scheme collapsed, Ponzi pleaded guilty . to fraud and was sentenced to five years in a federal prison. But that didn’t stop Evans lying to detectives, saying the investments had been legitimate business deals gone wrong. He even bought a £21,000 BMW with stolen cash and tried to sell it. He eventually pleaded guilty to ten counts of fraud and one of converting criminal property. Christopher . Stables, defending, said: ‘This was an unreal lifestyle, a Walter Mitty . lifestyle. He was handling extremely large sums of money and was . seduced by that lifestyle. ‘He . was weak and he accepts that. It was a lifestyle that gave him high . living, luxuries and mixing with celebrities. It was almost a drug.’ Judge Watson jailed Evans, of Great Sankey in Cheshire, for five years and three months, telling him: ‘You held yourself out as a financial adviser. 'The reality was you were a very plausible conman. You had superficial charm and amiability to impress would-be clients with the promise of high returns. ‘You demonstrated what can only be described as a flash lifestyle which you concocted to give the impression of success. 'The hospitality and wooing of clients was all done to get them on the hook. ‘The list of expenditures is breathtaking. You spent £300,000 on jewellery, £150,000 on accommodation, at least £50,000 on clothing, £300,000 on travel, £1.5million on cars. ‘You spent £300k on jewellery, £150k on accommodation, at least £50k on clothing, £300k on travel and £1.5million on cars. 'The cars would do justice to several programmes of Top Gear. 'This was relentless greed which knew no bounds.’ Pricey: Evans spent £29,000 on clothing at Selfridges. The Oxford Street store in London is pictured . Sentencing: Evans has been convicted of ten counts of fraud and one of converting criminal property, and received over five years in prison .

      "193. By . Ryan Gorman . Accused fraudster: Craig Siegel is charged with defrauding 19 people in a rental scheme and dumping urine over the head of a building inspector . A Florida man under investigation for fraud was arrested Monday after throwing a bucket of urine at a building code inspector on his property. The inspector was on Craig Siegel’s Siesta Key property because he built an addition last year without building permits and also was running a scheme defrauding potential renters, authorities said. Police charged the 44-year-old chiropractor with 19 counts of fraud for his rental scheme. He was also charged with criminal mischief and battery on a code inspector for dousing the worker in urine. The inspector was on site at 7.20 a.m. to ‘dismantle the modifications,’ according to the Herald-Tribune. Seigel had other ideas, and dumped the bucket of urine on him to stop the work, police said. Authorities accuse Seigel of duping people into paying for what they thought was rent on a 12 bedroom mansion when in reality it was a five bedroom McMansion. Payments totalling about $53,000 were made to a rental company owned by the accused urine thrower. Victims either accepted their downsized fate or found other accommodations, sources told WWSB. Others demanded their money back. Where it happened: The Siesta Key home where Seigel reportedly doused an inspector in urine . Seigel insisted they sue him because the money was gone. (I said) You give me my money back,’ victim Denise Blair recalled to WTVT. ‘He said no, we are not in the financial position to do that.’ But he did have the money to make more than $170,000 in contributions to a retirement account last year, officials said. He is being held in jail on a $55,000 bond.\n",

A British poker ace who disappeared from his Costa del Sol mansion and was being hunted by police for allegedly stealing more than €3million from investors, has been found living in Berkshire. Playboy Nigel Goldman, 56, who counts James Hewitt and Sir Mark Thatcher among his social circle, is being investigated by the Guardia Civil and Action Fraud, the UK's fraud and internet crime reporting centre. Earlier this year the only trace of Goldman since he vanished in Marbella, was a text message to a former employer three weeks ago which read: ‘I did not set out to be a thief.’ Goldman, who drove a red Ferrari, has been found living in a modest home in the picturesque village of Kintbury, Berkshire under the alias of Howard del Monte . Spanish police were probing claims that the broker from Edgbaston in Birmingham, left people empty handed and unable to access their bank funds. However police were unable to trace him after they received complaints about his Tangier-based company, International Financial Investment. But now Goldman, who drove a red Ferrari, has been found living in a modest house in the picturesque village of Kintbury, Berkshire under the alias of Howard del Monte.

Goldman's lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira . He uses the site to buy and sell coins, stamps and antiques. When approached at his Berkshire home Goldman refused to comment and his lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira. But a neighbour said: ‘Everyone in the village knows he's Goldman, whatever name he goes under.’ Geoff Whitton, originally from Cornwall, is trying to locate €20,000 he says he handed to Goldman.The 49-year-old writer said: ‘If he's a legitimate businessman, why hasn't he contacted me? ‘I gave €10,000 in May, 2012, and €10,000 two months later. Goldman made me a profit for two months, then a loss for the same amount. Goldman is said to have moved in the same social circles as cad James Hewitt (left) and Sir Mark Thatcher . ‘For the next one-and-a-half years, I was in limbo. He'd say, \"Just trust me and you will receive a profit in October 2013\".’ Goldman, who enjoys swigging champagne and smoking expensive cigars, has a history of dishonesty, in his own book, 'High Stakes: How I Blew £14 million' published in 2006, he confesses being sent to prison twice for fraud. A review on his book reads: ‘Goldman seems to show little remorse - and more than a little contempt - for the victims whose money he lived off so handsomely.’ Despite his past, Goldman is claiming that he, and others, have been duped this time and believes his brokers were running a Ponzi scheme with everyone's money. A Ponzi scheme is an investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing capital or new capital paid by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organisation running the operation. Goldman has admitted in writing to owing as much as £658,000 (€800,000). However a lawyer acting for investors who claim to have lost cash is stating that he is chasing €3 million, a figure rising daily. Flashy Goldman made his name at some of the world's biggest poker tournaments around the world, winning thousands. Lawyer Antonia Flores, said: ‘So far we have spoken to victims in Almeria, Malaga and Jaen. ‘In our most recent estimate it looks like reaching €3 million. ‘The first thing he did right was openly admit to all his wrongdoings and say he paid for it and was a new man. ‘That was a success. People could not talk about his past, people actually felt sorry for him. ‘It is large scale, police have not yet issued an arrest warrant, but they are not far from doing that.’ Goldman offered investments in a host of commodities including bullion, stocks and shares although he is not a regulated financial advisor due to his criminal convictions.

      "196. By . Nick Harris . The ownership circus at Leeds United took an extraordinary twist on Wednesday when it was revealed that the club’s former managing director David Haigh has been arrested in Dubai on suspicion of embezzlement, fraud and money-laundering. Haigh was the frontman and deputy CEO of Dubai-based bankers GFH Capital when they bought Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012. He became managing director and introduced controversial Italian Massimo Cellino to GFHC. Cellino subsequently bought 75 per cent of Leeds from GFHC and dispensed with Haigh, who had resigned from GFHC. Trouble: Former Leeds managing director David Haigh has been arrested in Dubai . Claims: Former Leeds owners GFH, whose employee Salem Patel is pictured (left), have accused Haigh (right) of being involved in financial irregularities . The Dubai bankers, with a Bahrain head office, retain 25 per cent of the club and it is they who called in the police. GFHC . released a statement on Wednesday confirming that a former employee has . been arrested ‘on suspicion of fraud, embezzlement and money-laundering . while he was employed at the bank.’ Haigh, . 36, has told friends that he is ‘shocked and horrified’ at his arrest, . which happened on Sunday. By Wednesday he had been in custody for three . nights. A source close to Haigh said: ‘He is confident he has done . nothing wrong or illegal... and that the Dubai authorities will see . through what he insists are baseless allegations.’ Police . in Leeds spoke to Haigh last month over allegations that funds had been . inappropriately spent on installing spy cameras in the board room and . toilets at Elland Road. Haigh admitted installing the cameras but said . he had legitimately acquired the equipment after reports of drug-taking . on the premises. Police continue to investigate. The backdrop to the latest arrest is a bitter ongoing wrangle between Cellino and GFHC. Sources . have told Sportsmail that Cellino was surprised at the extent of the . club’s debts and ongoing losses when he finally took over.

      "197. By . Dan Bloom . A British witch doctor who conned her 'patients' out of £1million to become one of the most prolific conwomen in history has been jailed for 10 years. Juliette D'Souza, 59, persuaded 11 clients to hand over their life savings - which she insisted would be hung from a magic tree in the Amazon as a sacrifice. Instead she spent the cash on first class flights, antique furniture and a £3,000 Hermes handbag. 'Pure evil': Juliette D'Souza told one client that a relative would die if she did not continue giving her money . Jailed: Juliette D'Souza has been described as one of Britain's most prolific conwomen in history . Bizarrely, she would buy designer goods she never used and rent luxury homes which she never visited. Today D'Souza was jailed for 10 years at Blackfriars Crown Court, where police claimed she was every bit as dangerous as a violent criminal. Judge Ian Karsten QC . said she had cast a 'spell' over her victims - who had cancer, disabilities, sick relatives, job worries and fertility problems - persuading them to hand . over the money or face 'terrifying' consequences including the death of their loved ones. A jury took just an hour to convict her of 23 counts of fraud and obtaining property by deception, spanning 12 years from 1998 to 2010. The self-proclaimed healer said she had helped cure John Cleese’s daughter of cancer, boasted of knowing Princess Diana and claimed she could introduce a young . singer to Simon Cowell. Advertising her services . in Tatler magazine, she charged just £35 for a consultation but then . demanded huge sums to be used as the 'sacrifices' in Suriname, South America. There she claimed two other shamans would perform . rituals around the money before it was sent back with all the victims' problems resolved - but the money was never returned. In one especially horrifying case, a client handed over £176,000 in a desperate bid to fall pregnant. The witch doctor of Hampstead: The 59-year-old spent the money on luxury goods she never used . When she finally conceived, D'Souza told her to have . an abortion because . her foetus would be grossly deformed and ‘evil’. Her lies were finally uncovered, along with . ‘voodoo black magic’ which included freezers . stuffed with rotting meat and an abandoned capuchin monkey which was later adopted by Stephen Fry. Judge Karsten told her today: 'It is the worst case of confidence fraud I have ever had to deal with or indeed that I have ever heard of. 'The most serious aspect of this case is that you wrecked the lives of a number of your victims and you have done it out of pure greed. 'You told a number of victims the money would be returned. The reality, as it has emerged, is that you didn’t send any of this . money to South America. You used the cash for your own purposes. 'You . cheated each and every one of these victims. You were able to exercise a . considerable influence and indeed a spell over these victims.' A number of victims were 'subjugated' to . her will so that they 'lost all of their autonomy' and became 'entirely . dependent' on her, he said. 'To reinforce their dependence on you, . you initially saw to it that they were cut off from their friends and . family,' he added. 'You warned them about the \"evil temperament\" of the people to . whom they were close.' Many victims were left in financial ruin, with one man 'as poor as a church mouse', while the conwoman 'remorselessly extracted' more than £200,000 from an elderly woman over several years. The official amount she defrauded was £908,400, but on the evidence given by victims the final sum was closer to £1million. Police believe the total taken by D'Souza - who had similar previous convictions - could be higher still. D’Souza’s . web was finally untangled in 2007 as she made a series of mistakes . which aroused her victims’ suspicions. She claimed to have attended St . Hilliard’s College, Oxford, which does not exist and got the name of . Princess Diana’s sister wrong. The . woman who had an abortion realised she had been scammed and went to . Hampstead police station in north London, but said officers ‘laughed in . my face’. Victims: Hampstead osteopath Keith Bender, left, referred clients to D'Souza in the belief she could help. Opera singer Silvia Eaves handed over £256,000 for help with stomach problems and to invest in a clinic in Peru . This left her so . angry she forced her way into D’Souza’s home with the help of Mr Bender, . who was paying the rent on that property, and three others. Inside they . found the voodoo treasure trove – which also included drawings of an . ‘evil eye’, burned photos and a brand new barrister’s wig. D’Souza . would give her 'customers' detailed instructions about how the money . was to be paid - always in cash and in a brown envelope. Part of her . system was to demand a full-length photograph from each victim. One . victim - who was told to pay £18,000 or her partner would die - said: . 'I was absolutely terrified. I was living in fear and doing what I was . told.' Another was . 82-year-old former opera singer Sylvia Eaves, who was duped out of more . than £350,000 by D’Souza between 1998 and 2010. Another still was the mother of a . ten-year-old boy with Down’s Syndrome who was conned out of £42,000 when . D’Souza claimed she could cure his behavioural problems. The . widow, whom the judge described as a 'delightful lady', handed over the . money for various reasons including help with a stomach problem and to . 'save' her ill sister. Voodoo dolls: D'Souza's con was exposed when Mr Bender and property manager Keith Mcmahon grew suspicious and broke into her four flats at Willoughby Road in Hampstead, north London . Pet: Mr Bender had been visiting one flat to feed D'Souza's pet monkey, Joey, but did not dare enter the remaining flats for fear they were cursed. The money was later adopted by the TV comic Stephen Fry . 'I’m . relieved that she won’t be doing it to anybody else,' Mrs Eaves said . today. 'I feel terribly sad that somebody who is so clever would resort . to that, especially as she was a friend of mine. I feel terribly let . down that she could behave like that. 'She relieved me of a lot of money but I’m still here. I was gullible, I suppose, but my sister was very ill at the time.' Other . victims included retired solicitor Richard Collier-Wright, who paid . £7,000 to cure his terminal leukaemia, and former photographer Jocelyn . Bain-Hogg, who handed D’Souza thousands to improve the health of his . mother who was having heart surgery. A . couple, who cannot be named, gave tens of thousands to the fraudster . after she claimed she could help with their child’s disability and . behavioural problems. Another . victim, Geoffrey Wheeler, handed over around £160,000 to 'protect' him . from being made redundant but was left in financial ruin. Gear: Piles of rubbish filled the flats and stacks of carrier bags from designer stores littered the rooms . Her barrister, Stephen Fidler, told the court D’Souza’s elderly mother had been unwell for a . considerable time and she visits her every day. But the judge told her: 'I find no mitigating factors in your case at all.' Detective . Constables Linda Kernot and Fiona Graham said: 'We are very pleased . with the sentence. It reflects the serious nature of her actions and the . fact that she has shown no remorse. 'We are relieved that her evil schemes have been stopped as we consider Juliette D’Souza as dangerous as a violent offender. 'She . is a nasty, cruel person who targeted vulnerable people, preying on . them when they were desperate for support and guidance. In the end, her . greed and arrogance was her downfall. 'We want to thank the victims for showing great courage in standing up to her and giving their evidence.'\n",
      "198. By . Kate Lyons . The U.S. Justice Department has filed papers accusing Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, as being the leader of the gang behind the software . The dangerous cyber pandemic known as Gameover Zeus could have infected thousands of Australian computers and be lying dormant gathering data, experts say. The malware, which the FBI estimates has hit between 500,000 and one million computers worldwide, has resulted in users losing tens of millions of dollars. Gameover Zeus, which experts say is 'sophisticated' and capable of evading anti-virus software, infects a user's machine when they open a PDF or click on a link sent to them in an email. Once it is set up on the computer, Gameover Zeus will intercept all financial transactions and rewrite them, so that payments made by the user will be redirected into other accounts. The malware also has the power to disguise unapproved payments that are made, meaning that thefts might have occurred even if accounts appear normal. 'It keeps track of balances; it automatically corrects the numbers on the balance. It's so sophisticated that it hides its tacks,' said Nick Savvides, senior principal systems engineer at Symantec Australia. The malware has hit computer users around the world, with the most incidents reported in the U.S. and Italy – 13 percent and 12 percent respectively. Seven percent of incidents have occurred in the UK. There are no figures available on how many Australian computer users have had money stolen through the malware and Mr Savvides says this is because so far Gameover Zeus 'hasn't been targeting Australian financial institutions or users yet in any significant scale.'

Gameover Zeus has been so difficult to shut down because it uses peer-to-peer software, meaning that even if the main server is shut down, infected computers can continue to communicate with one another and continue operating. Another reason is that once installed on a computer, Gameover Zeus has the ability to evade anti-virus software. 'Once it has infected [a computer], it's very hard to get it off,' said Mr Savvides.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers accusing a Russian named Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev as being the leader of the gang behind the software. The complaint claims the software has been responsible for the loss of more than $100m from individuals and a string of major companies, with estimates that members of the gang behind the malware would have amassed tens of millions of dollars each. Could Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic? He is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic. But the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and ‘slavik’. The 31-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as ‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online banking accounts. The FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009. Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname ‘lucky12345’ by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on a number of charges including Bank Fraud, Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Aggravated Identity Theft. On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy, Computer Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud and Money Laundering. Then just days ago on May 30, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘lucky12345’ to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud. He is described as white with brown hair (though his head is usually shaved) and brown eyes. He is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds (82kg). Bogachev was last known to live in Anapa, Russia. He is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. The software can lock the information on a computer and hold it to ransom - one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals, which is around $500. File picture . Computer users who fear they could fall victim to the virus are advised to install anti-virus software and ensure their operating system has the latest security updates.

Users are also advised to change their passwords, as original passwords may have been compromised during infection, and to enable automatic updates on their anti-virus software. Users are also advised being cautious when handling unsolicited or unexpected emails, particularly during the two-week window before hackers rebuild their network.

Chief executive Tony Neate has since apologised and claimed that the website had 'quadrupled' its capacity. It appeared to be up and running on Wednesday afternoon. He added that the site itself had not been the subject of a cyber attack and that demand itself had caused the problems.

      "201. By . Damien Gayle . Arrested: Fugitive Kazakh oligarch Mukhtar . Ablyazov, who was held in France after special forces backed by armoured vehicles . swooped on his rented home . French police special forces called in airpower and armoured vehicles for an operation to seize a wealthy fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted in three countries over a $5billion bank fraud. Mukhtar Ablyazov was held after paramilitary police swooped on a rental home in the town of Mouans Sartoux, near Nice in south-east France, said Solange Legras, chief prosecutor at an appeals court in Aix-en-Provence. The police used 'powerful means'  - . including armoured vehicles and a plane - because Ablyazov was known to . have a 'private militia' at his disposal, said Ms Legras, whose office . focuses on international cases. In the event, no shots were fired during the operation. The 50-year-old is wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan over a string of allegations of fraud and organised crime. He disappeared from the UK in February 2012 just before a British court sentenced him to 22-months in jail for contempt of court in a financial fraud trial. He was subsequently stripped of assets worth more than £150million in British assets, including an £18million mansion in one of London's most exclusive streets. Ablyazov, who has been wanted by Interpol since 2009, was held on allegations of 'large-scale fraud in an organised group', Ms Legras said by phone, shortly after meeting with Ablyazov to explain the possible extradition process. A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the energy-rich Central Asian nation since before the Soviet collapse. Shortly after setting up a pro-reform party in 2001, Ablyazov was sentenced to six years in prison for abuse of public office. However, he was pardoned by Mr Nazarbayev and released in 2003, vowing to stay out of politics - a promise he broke by funnelling money to the opposition. Kazakhstan's prosecutors have . described Ablyazov as the head of an extremist, criminal conspiracy bent . on 'seizing power by inciting civil strife and hatred.' He is wanted . there on charges of siphoning off at least $5billion from BTA Bank, . which based in the central Asian country's business capital, Almaty. The . prosecutor in Astana, the Kazakh capital, said Interpol had informed . the government of Ablyazov's arrest, which was carried out at the . request of Ukraine, where he is wanted on charges of alleged . embezzlement of funds from a local branch of the BTA bank. He is also . sought by Russia in connection with embezzlement charges involving BTA . bank and a Russian company. Dissident: A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country since before the Soviet collapse . There was no extradition request from the UK, where Ablyazov was in February 2012 convicted of contempt of court after attempting to hide the extent of his wealth from a legal action taken by the now state-owned BTA bank in the hope of recovering some of the allegedly embezzled funds. Mr Justice Teare, sitting in the High Court, said Ablyazov was accused of 'fraud on an epic scale' and had committed 'deliberate and substantial' contempts by breaching an asset-freezing order imposed to stop money vanishing before litigation concluded. The conviction was upheld at the Court of Appeal last November, where senior judge Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov had shown 'rare cynicism and deviousness' as he fought the claims against him and ordered him stripped of assets worth more than £150million. Mr Ablyazov’s property portfolio in Britain is alone worth more than £63million. His Bishops Avenue property — Carlton House — is worth £17million and is in a street nicknamed Billionaires' Row. The mansion has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, and is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts. He also has a £1m apartment in Albert Court, closet to Lord's cricket ground; and Oaklands Park - a 100-acre estate on the edge of Windsor Great Park with tennis courts and helicopter pad. In a statement on his Facebook page, . Madiyar Ablyazov, the former banker's son, said he feared what would . happen if his father were deported to Kazakhstan. 'We . beg the French authorities not to grant Kazakhstan our father. He is a . man of honour, who has been fighting all his life, and sacrificed so . much, for freedom and democracy in Kazakhstan,' the younger Ablyazov . wrote. 'We are afraid for his life.' Taken: Ablyazov's mansion in Hampstead, which has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts . Ablyazov's arrest came after the deportation of his wife and young daughter from Italy to Kazakhstan caused a political crisis in Rome last month. Because France has no extradition agreement with Kazakhstan, Ms Legras, the Aix-en-Provence prosecutor, said she is focusing on the extradition request from Ukraine for now. Under the extradition process, the requesting country has 40 days to send its legal dossier to French authorities. Once that is received, French prosecutors will have five days to present Ablyazov to investigating magistrates. 'In my opinion, this isn't going to happen before the autumn,' she said. The managing director of BTA Bank today told MailOnline the company welcomed Ablyazov's arrest. Pavel Prosyankin said: 'This arrest is a result of the Bank’s diligent efforts through the British justice system to recover the billions of dollars he stole while Chairman. 'We have sought his arrest to prevent him from further dissipating assets which the English High Court ordered to be put in receivership. 'He has flouted many court orders and fled the UK after we secured another High Court judgment sentencing him to prison in England. 'He is now in custody and we are optimistic that we will be better positioned to recover more of the assets which the court has authorised us to seize.' Ablyazov denies wrongdoing and says the allegations are politically motivated.\n",
      "202. By . James  Nye . In his first interview since 2011, when he was exposed as fabricating large parts of his best-selling book Three Cups of Tea - author Greg Mortenson has claimed that he did it because he was willing to 'kill himself' to raise money for impoverished people. Speaking to NBC's Tom Brokaw for an interview that will air on Tuesday, Mortenson, 56, said that while he admitted to hearing the 'alarms' over his 2006 work, he refused to acknowledge them in case they deflected from his goal of boosting his humanitarian projects. Famously claiming that he had met Mother Teresa, although she had died three years previously, Mortenson begs for a second chance in the exclusive interview and claims that he has settled all the allegations he mis-spent money from his charity flying around the world in his own private jet. New beginning: Greg Mortenson speaks with NBC's Tom Brokwa and claims that he told falsehoods in his book because of his dramatic zeal to raise money for his humanitarian projects . Claiming in his interview with Brokaw that events did transpire in Three Cups of Tea as he wrote them - just not in the order he outlined them - Mortenson said that he ignored the warning signs in his own mind not to do this and promised not to repeat his mistakes. 'It still just has puzzled me and why there wasn't, at some point, in your mind, an alarm that went off and said, 'this just isn't right in some way,' Brokaw asked in the interview. No more lies: Tom Mortenson said that he is interested in the public granting him a second chance after the lies he told in his best selling memoir Three Cups of Tea . 'There were alarms, Tom,' Mortenson said. 'I didn't listen to them. I was willing to basically kill myself to raise money and help the projects.' After its release in 2006, Three Cups of Tea became a best seller and it, along with Mortenson's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years, resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the Central Asia Institute - the charity he ran. Mortenson himself reaped financial benefits at the expense of the CAI, including the free promotion of Three Cups of Tea and his later book, Stones Into Schools. He also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies CAI bought to donate to libraries, schools, churches and military personnel, a 2012 report by the Montana Attorney General said. After that investigation Mortenson was ordered to reimburse his charity to the tune of more than $1million under a settlement agreement. Three Cups of Tea details how Mortenson resolved to build schools in Central Asia after he became lost and wandered into a poor Pakistani village, then follows him as he expands his school-building efforts there. The book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson founded in 1996 with a $1million donation from Dr. Jean Hoerni, a Swiss physicist and mountaineer. Charity: Greg Mortenson with local businesswomen in Gojal Hunza, in Pakistan - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people ther . The books came under scrutiny in 2011 when reports by 60 Minutes and author Jon Krakauer alleged that Mortenson fabricated parts of both and that he benefited financially from the charity. Mortenson is alleged to have made up stories about how he built the schools and one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held Mother Teresa's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000. Mother Teresa passed away in 1997 - the same week that Princess Diana lost her life in car crash in Paris. Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue. Also noted as questionable was Mr Mortenson's account that he wandered lost into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb the world's second-highest peak, K2, then decided to build a school there. His previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village. The 2006 book Three Cups of Tea, which sold millions of copies, was conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of his institute, founded by Mr Mortenson in 1996, and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations. Mortenson has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering, fraud, deceit, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Shamashatu, Pakistan: Greg Mortenson from Bozeman, Montana the former executive director of the Central Asia Institute, listens as newly arrived refugees from Afghanistan tell their stories on break from making bricks . However, in the aftermath of the 60 Minutes investigation Mortenson was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights, family vacations and luxury personal items. Mortenson's control of the Central Asia Institute went largely unchallenged by its board of directors, which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him, the report prepared by the Montana Attorney General's office said. Fabrications: Mortenson's 2006 book \"Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace...One School at a Time\" chronicled his failed attempt to climb K2 . When an employee would question his practices, Mortenson either resisted or ignored the person. The result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for. Itemized expenses listed as program-related were missing supporting receipts and documentation. Employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to CAI credit cards. In 2012, Mortenson was told he must reimburse the charity more than $1million under a settlement agreement - according to Montana's Attorney General. The attorney general's probe focused only on the charity's finances and operations, and did not examine the books' contents. The yearlong investigation from 2011 to 2012 concluded that the Central Asia Institute took in far more donations than it spent, and had $23million in reserves. The charity was judged to need better oversight so that too much control is not in one person's hands, the audit found. ‘Mortenson's pursuits are noble and his achievements are important. However, serious internal problems in the management of CAI surfaced,’ Attorney General Steve Bullock said in the report. ‘Despite the severity of their errors, CAI is worth saving.’ Mortenson was permanently removed as CAI's executive director in November, 2012. Tragic: David Oliver Relin (right), who co-wrote the best-seller Three Cups of Tea with Greg Mortenson (left), about how Mortenson set up schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has killed himself, aged 49 . Following the stresses and strains in the wake of the 60 Minutes piece, Mortenson had heart surgery. The investigation by Montana's Attorney General also found that CAI spent $4.93million on advertising and promoting Mortenson's books, costs that the charity and the author had agreed to split but never did. CAI paid $2million in charter flights for Mortenson to keep his rigorous speaking engagement schedule before he started paying for his own travel in 2011. The investigation found that in many cases he was ‘double-dipping,’ where CAI paid for his travel to a speaking engagement and the host of the event also paid him a fee or honorarium for his travel, which Mortenson pocketed. Scrutiny: The book follows the adventures of co-author Greg Mortenson, pictured in Wakhan, northeastern Afghanistan in 2009, as he set up schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan . 'Dishonest': But critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and Mortenson, left, later admitted some facts were wrong. Relin suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath . Mortenson and his family also charged personal items to CAI in 2009-2010 amounting to $75,276 that included ‘LL Bean clothing, iTunes, luggage, luxurious accommodations and even vacations,’ according to the report. The controversy became tragic in November of 2011 when co-author of Three Cups of Tea, David Oliver Relin committed suicide. Relin suffered emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in the book. Mortenson, 52, lives in Montana with his wife, a clinical psychologist, and their two young children. His biography describes him as 'a living hero to rural communities of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he has gained the trust of Islamic leaders, military and militia commanders, government officials and tribal chiefs from his tireless effort to champion education, especially for girls.'\n",
      "203. By . Emily Crane . Four men have been arrested after police swooped on an alleged credit card skimming syndicate targeting taxi customers throughout Sydney. Officers found 800 blank credit cards, a card encoder and a laptop computer when they arrested four men at a motel at Chullora, west of Sydney, last week. The cards had the potential to fraudulently obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, products and services. Police seized a card encoder last week in an alleged credit card skimming syndicate targeting taxi customers throughout Sydney . A unit in Sussex Street, Sydney, was also raided and police seized two computers, mobile phones, and financial and identification documents. Police will allege the four men were members of a well organised, sophisticated credit card skimming syndicate and obtained credit card details from a variety of sources, including skimming devices in taxis. 'I checked my account recently and discovered that $2000 had been withdrawn two days earlier from an ATM in a suburb I'd never been to and another $2000 transaction had been made the following day in the city. My card was still in my wallet and I'm careful to cover my hand when I enter my PIN at ATM's, so I had no idea who had taken the money and how they had done it. Feeling sick I called my bank to report the unauthorised transactions and was asked whether I had used the EFTPOS facility in a taxi cab recently and whether the driver had complained that his machine wasn't working before trying a different machine. Be wary of cab drivers using two different machines to swipe your card . That had happened to me a few weeks earlier and as the bank explained is a very common method used to skim cards and PIN numbers. I was warned to only ever use my credit card in a cab, before the bank quickly refunded the missing funds - including both the ATM fees!' - Melissa Milowski . The skimmed information was allegedly then used to manufacture fraudulent credit cards, which were used to make ATM withdrawals and purchases. The Acting Commander of the Fraud and Cybercrime Squad, Detective Acting Superintendent John Watson said 'People need to be alert every time they use their credit or debit card'. He went on to warn that 'It doesn’t matter whether you’re withdrawing money at an ATM, paying for a meal at a restaurant or settling a fare in a taxi, never let your card out of your sight.' 'Some skimming devices look exactly like legitimate payment terminals, allowing criminals to skim a card’s details right under the cardholder’s nose.' The arrests came several months after Fraud and Cybercrime Squad detectives started investigating the men. A 28-year-old Sydney man was charged with directing the criminal group, dealing in identification information and possessing equipment to manufacture documents. Three other men, a Potts Point man, 28, and a Rockdale man, 24, and a Moorebank man, 29, have been charged with dealing in identification information, possessing document manufacturing equipment and participating in a criminal group. All four men were granted condition bail and will appear at Burwood Local Court later this month. Detective Superintendent Watson is encouraging any taxi drivers or customers who have information concerning the use of skimming devices in taxis to contact Crime Stoppers. 'If you are a driver and you were approached by people asking you to use a skimming device, or you are aware of other taxi drivers using these devices, please do the right thing and contact Crime Stoppers/' 800 blank credit cards were found as part of the raid and police allege they had the potential to fraudulently obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, products and services . Four men who were members of a well organised, sophisticated credit card skimming syndicate were arrested . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
      "204. By . James  Nye . Three Cups of Tea author Greg Mortenson has made the unabashed claim that he is thankful to the reporters who exposed the fabrications in his New York Times best-selling book and accused him of mishandling money at his charity. 'In maybe a strange way, I’d like to thank CBS and Jon Krakauer because, had they not brought these issues up, we could have gotten into more serious problems,' said Mortenson, 56, about the 60 Minutes exposé and that of Into the Wild author Krakauer. Speaking for the first time since the allegations of lying in print and appropriating money were first made in 2011, Mortenson said that the stories he recounted in his book did happen - but that he was forced to be creative because he was under a strict word limit. Scroll Down for Video: . Admission: Greg Mortenson attempted to claim that he was thankful that all his fabrications in Three Cups of Tea were exposed - because it saved him bigger trouble in the future . 'I stand by the stories. The stories happened, but … not in the sequence or the timing,' Mortenson told NBC's Tom Brokaw. 'What I regret is that we were under tremendous pressure to bring about a million words down to 300,000 words.' Contrite: Mortenson was apologetic though to the people who thinks he let down with his inaccurate book which details his experiences in Afghanistan . After its release in 2006, Three Cups of Tea became a best seller and it, along with Mortenson's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years, resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the Central Asia Institute - the charity he ran. Three Cups of Tea details how Mortenson resolved to build schools in Central Asia after he became lost and wandered into a poor Pakistani village, then follows him as he expands his school-building efforts there. The books came under scrutiny in 2011 when reports by 60 Minutes and author Jon Krakauer alleged that Mortenson fabricated parts of both and that he benefited financially from the charity. Mortenson is alleged to have made up stories about how he built the schools and one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held Mother Teresa's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000. Mother Teresa passed away in 1997 - the same week that Princess Diana lost her life in car crash in Paris. Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue. 'I always have operated from my heart. I'm not a really head person. And I really didn't factor in the very important things of accountability, transparency,' Mortenson told Brokaw. Charity: Greg Mortenson with local businesswomen in Gojal Hunza, in Pakistan - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people ther . Mortenson said he’s spent a lot of time owning up to his mistakes. 'Yes, I've talked to people who were very adamant that I make changes. I have apologized to them,' he said. 'I'd also like to apologize to everybody. I let a lot of people down.' But Mortenson said his cleanup effort remains a work in progress. 'In 'Three Cups of Tea,' the first chapter, the first word is 'failure.' I failed in many ways, and it's an important lesson,' he said. 'I'm going to try as hard as i can never to make the same mistakes again.' In his first interview since 2011, when he was exposed as fabricating large parts of his best-selling book Three Cups of Tea - author Greg Mortenson has claimed that he did it because he was willing to 'kill himself' to raise money for impoverished people. Speaking to NBC's Tom Brokaw Mortenson, 56, said that while he admitted to hearing the 'alarms' over his 2006 work, he refused to acknowledge them in case they deflected from his goal of boosting his humanitarian projects. Famously claiming that he had met Mother Teresa, although she had died three years previously, Mortenson begs for a second chance in the exclusive interview and claims that he has settled all the allegations he mis-spent money from his charity flying around the world in his own private jet. Claiming in his interview with Brokaw that events did transpire in Three Cups of Tea as he wrote them - just not in the order he outlined them - Mortenson said that he ignored the warning signs in his own mind not to do this and promised not to repeat his mistakes. 'It still just has puzzled me and why there wasn't, at some point, in your mind, an alarm that went off and said, 'this just isn't right in some way,' Brokaw asked in the interview. Shamashatu, Pakistan: Greg Mortenson from Bozeman, Montana the former executive director of the Central Asia Institute, listens as newly arrived refugees from Afghanistan tell their stories on break from making bricks . 'There were alarms, Tom,' Mortenson said. 'I didn't listen to them. I was willing to basically kill myself to raise money and help the projects.' Mortenson himself reaped financial benefits at the expense of the CAI, including the free promotion of Three Cups of Tea and his later book, Stones Into Schools. Fabrications: Mortenson's 2006 book \"Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace...One School at a Time\" chronicled his failed attempt to climb K2 . He also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies CAI bought to donate to libraries, schools, churches and military personnel, a 2012 report by the Montana Attorney General said. After that investigation Mortenson was ordered to reimburse his charity to the tune of more than $1million under a settlement agreement. The book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson founded in 1996 with a $1million donation from Dr. Jean Hoerni, a Swiss physicist and mountaineer. Among many indescrepencies was Mr Mortenson's account that he wandered lost into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb the world's second-highest peak, K2, then decided to build a school there. His previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village. The 2006 book Three Cups of Tea, which sold millions of copies, was conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of his institute, founded by Mr Mortenson in 1996, and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations. Mortenson has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering, fraud, deceit, breach of contract and unjust enrichment.

      "205. By . Guy Adams . If clothes could talk, this particular array would exhale a cloud of cigar smoke, adopt an arrogant smirk, and declare: ‘Greed is Good!’ Wearing colourful braces, silk patterned ties, bright socks, expensive loafers, and gelled-back hair, groups of boisterous office workers stride through central London. The men chain smoke, or carry brick-sized mobile telephones last seen in the possession of Gordon Gekko, the rapacious financier at the centre of the film Wall Street. Scroll down for video . Members of staff from the Energy recruitment firm Spencer Ogden leaving their offices to watch the movie The Wolf of Wall Street . A man walks with a brick mobile phone (left) while other members of staff walk to the movie viewing . The women opt for fur coats, garish scarves, and striped ties chosen in apparent homage to Jules Van Patten, the money-obsessed, cocaine-snorting female banker played by Demi Moore in cult Eighties movie St Elmo’s Fire. This very public celebration of City bonus culture took place shortly after 4pm on Monday outside the offices of Spencer Ogden, a recruitment and headhunting firm which specialises in the oil and gas sectors. The company is among a wave of London businesses — including banks, law firms, stockbrokers, and hedge funds — organising fancy-dress screenings of Martin Scorsese’s latest epic movie The Wolf Of Wall Street. Roughly 150 employees were asked to show up in ‘power suits and plenty of hair gel,’ according to Simon Taylor, Spencer Ogden’s development director, who described the dress code as ‘a bit of fun’. The men chain smoke, or carry brick-sized mobile telephones while the women opt for fur coats, garish scarves, and striped ties . Colleagues dress in their 'power suits' ahead of watching The Wolf on Wall Street . So boundless is enthusiasm for his story that cinemas in London have trebled private hire prices . They spent the next three hours watching Scorsese’s biopic of Jordan Belfort, a spectacularly corrupt American stockbroker whose appetite for sex, drugs, and money saw him dubbed: ‘The most debauched banker of them all.’ ‘Our business is all about sales, and essentially so was Belfort’s,’ said Taylor beforehand. ‘So when we watch this film, we’ll basically see someone doing what we do every day; aside from all the illegal stuff, of course. ‘The sales techniques he used are the same. The way he taught staff to close a deal. The timing of when he spoke or kept his mouth shut. That’s why we are fascinated by Jordan Belfort: he was a hell of a salesman.’ Wearing colourful braces and silk patterned ties workers left their office to watch the film . Belfort was also a prodigious crook. Nominated for five Oscars, the film tells how he made tens of millions of dollars from illegal stock sales in the Nineties, spending most of it on yachts, cocaine, prostitutes, sports cars, and wild parties. Given these famous excesses — of which more later — not to mention the fact that Belfort was eventually imprisoned for fraud and money laundering, most viewers regard The Wolf Of Wall Street as a cautionary tale. Yet, in shameless disregard of post credit-crunch public opinion, a very different attitude appears to prevail in the City of London. Here, as these pictures suggest, the spectacularly immoral Belfort, played in the film by Leonardo  DiCaprio, is well on his way to becoming a folk hero. So boundless is enthusiasm for his story that cinemas in London have trebled private hire prices for screenings of the film. ‘We’ve never previously seen anything like the level of interest that we’ve seen in this film,’ says Will Swannell, CEO of Hire Space, one of London’s leading venue hire firms. ‘There has been a flurry of bookings. The usual price for a movie screening is in the region of £1,500. For this film, the going rate has risen to £4,500. It’s straightforward supply and demand.’ ‘It’s all a bit crazy,’ added an events manager at one City insurance broker. ‘The prices have sky-rocketed. I had to call a huge number of big cinemas before finding somewhere free.’ Highlighting the level of yuppie interest in The Wolf Of Wall Street was a viral email doing the rounds of City firms last week. It noted that the release of Wall Street (1987) and its sequel Money Never Sleeps (2010) coincided with major falls in stock indices. This week, by contrast, the FTSE has been on the verge of hitting an all-time-high. No doubt there were, therefore, happy faces in cinemas at The Barbican, Greenwich and Canary Wharf, as well as London’s West End, where finance houses held screenings of The Wolf Of Wall Street over the weekend. It seems there were also wide smiles in Stockholm, where the Scandinavian bank Nordea booked out a 140-seat cinema, according to a report carried by Reuters. Most City firms celebrating The Wolf Of Wall Street in London have been keeping a low profile, doubtless hoping to avoid negative PR. Much like at Stratton Oakmont staff are encouraged to work hard and play hard . The women opt for fur coats, garish scarves, and striped ties chosen in apparent homage to Jules Van Patten . However, those known to have held events include Sunrise Brokers, which invited clients to the upmarket Electric Cinema in Notting Hill, and FTI, a U.S. business consultancy which has hired out the Odeon in Covent Garden for 180 guests and 40 staff. ‘It’s a film about our industry, so of course everyone wants to see it,’ says one guest of Sunrise. ‘I’d estimate that 90 to 95 per cent of my colleagues have already been. It’s a hot ticket. ‘Despite everything that’s happened to the finance industry over the past five or six years, the City’s still a pretty brash place, and there’s huge nostalgia for the days of red braces and slicked-back hair.’ Many guests at private screenings of The Wolf Of Wall Street might have reflected on the ways that their working life imitates art. Lavish: Leonardo Di Caprio in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street . The film centres on the raucous offices of Belfort’s firm Stratton Oakmont, where male staff outnumbered females by roughly ten to one, and where debauchery wasn’t so much encouraged as mandatory. Scorsese shows, among other things, how Belfort spent tens of thousands of dollars each month hiring prostitutes for his 1,000 staff, who used cocaine, crack, marijuana, morphine, and the sleeping pill Quaaludes on an almost daily basis. Office pets included a nappy-wearing chimpanzee, a Macaw trained to say “f*** off!” and a goldfish which ended up being eaten by an executive. At the end of trading days, employees would hold dwarf-tossing contents. Scorsese shows how Belfort spent tens of thousands of dollars each month hiring prostitutes for his 1,000 staff . Most City firms celebrating The Wolf Of Wall Street in London have been keeping a low profile . At Spencer Ogden, illegal behaviour is of course never tolerated. However — much like at Stratton Oakmont — staff are encouraged to work hard and play hard, in a devotedly eccentric environment. Instead of a carpet, the firm’s main office is covered by astro-turf. Punch bags hang from the ceiling to help relieve stress, and employees who close deals are encouraged to take celebratory bike rides around the floor. Outrageous: Office pets included a nappy-wearing chimpanzee and a Macaw trained to say 'f*** off!' Staff who hit sales targets for three straight months are meanwhile allowed to spend a week working from an office the firm keeps in Ibiza (‘and no, we don’t expect them to do very much work,’ says Taylor). ‘We are a professional environment. We’d frown on people coming in on Friday morning with cocaine all over their face. They’d be sacked,’ he adds. ‘So you can’t say that Jordan Belfort is a hero to us. But he is, perhaps, an anti-hero.’ The headquarters of Goldman Sachs in lower Manhattan, just a four minute walk from the movie theatre where bankers were treated to a free screening of The Wolf of Wall Street in December . Bankers in New York City were treated to a free screening of ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ last month, with similar results to the scenes in London. The advanced free screening of Martin Scorsese’s movie was held at the Regal Battery Park theatre, a four minute walk from Goldman Sachs’ headquarters at 200 West Street in Manhattan. The building is so close in fact that you can see Goldman’s trading room floor from the cinema’s escalator. Steven Perlberg of the Business Insider, described the experience of watching the film amongst a finance-heavy audience as ‘disturbing’, who cheered every cocaine-addled move of Leonardo DiCaprio’s character Jordan Belfort. ‘There’s a lot of talk about how Wall Street has “changed” since the financial crisis,’ he wrote.‘But you wouldn’t necessarily know that from what these guys were cheering at. ‘When Belfort – a drug addict who later attempts to remain sober – rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash, there were cheers.’ He added that the worst part of watching the film was when Belfort is enlisted by the authorities to implicate others at his firm but attempts to save his deputy by writing on a piece of paper that he is wearing a wire. ‘And the crowd goes wild. Don’t rat! Stand by your firm!’\n",
      "206. By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . and Mike Browne . Shady: Tony Caplin was made chairman of the Public Works Loan Board by David Cameron . A vineyard owner cheated out of £100,000 by the Tory crony put in charge of billions of pounds of public money has denounced the bankrupt businessman as a  ‘devious b******’. Bill Hulme, who owns the Fleur Fields vineyard in Northamptonshire, backed calls for an inquiry into disgraced ex-Tory chief Tony Caplin, who was put in charge of Public Works Loan Board by David Cameron. ‘There is something wrong with the judgment of a Government that puts a bad man like that in charge of public money when he has duped innocent people like me and others out of enormous sums,’ said 71-year-old Mr Hulme. ‘The man is a devious b****** and had all the hallmarks of a conman. There should be an inquiry to establish the truth.’ Meanwhile, another businessman today speaks of how Caplin conned him out of another £250,000. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how Caplin, who ran the Cameron family stockbroking firm, was made chairman of the £60 billion quango despite being declared bankrupt. Mr Cameron claimed he had no idea the ‘quango king’, who owed more than £3 million, including £200,000 to the taxman, had been made bankrupt – and fired him immediately. We also revealed Caplin’s link to disgraced Iain Corby, former boss of a publicly funded Conservative MPs’ research group. Corby, who was sacked on Mr Cameron’s orders over sex texts and boozing claims, secretly emailed Caplin from his Commons office in an apparent bid to profit from a £5 billion deal. The Prime Minister hoped his instant dismissal of Caplin – who was also the Conservatives’ chief operating officer when Mr Cameron became party leader – would end the row, but The Mail on Sunday has established the scandal is much deeper. The picture now is of an unscrupulous man in cahoots with shady  figures who cheated innocent people out of vast sums – and tried to lie his way out of it. It raises key questions: why did Cameron trust Caplin with such a vast amount of public money? Did Caplin use his privileged Treasury role to abuse taxpayers’ money? And did friends in high places cover up his activities? The pressure for an inquiry into Caplin grew after new details emerged of how he: . A vivid account of the misery caused by Caplin is provided by Bill Hulme and wife Flora. They set up their vineyard 14 years ago, which has become one of England’s most successful winemakers – but they were rocked when Caplin cheated them out of £100,000. Charge sheet: The complaints against Tory crony Tony Caplin investigated by The Mail on Sunday . They say they were persuaded to lend him the money in 2010 by their financial adviser. What they didn’t know was that the adviser was, like Caplin, soon to be embroiled in a separate financial scandal. Mr Hulme recalls: ‘He said Caplin was worth about £2 million, had deals going through and would soon pay me back, so I agreed.’ The couple say their adviser played up Caplin’s role as former head of Panmure Gordon stockbrokers, which employed three generations of Camerons, including the Prime Minister’s father Ian. ‘It sounded impressive.’ So they lent Caplin the money – but ‘then he stopped paying interest. ‘Another man told me Caplin did the same to him. We were told he was paying cheques into his wife’s account. They are both “A Caplin.” ‘It turned out he already had huge debts when I lent him money. If I’d known I wouldn’t have gone near him.’ Vineyard owners: Flora and Bill Hulme lost out when they lent Caplin £100,000 . When Caplin was quizzed at a bankruptcy hearing in February 2012, it seemed he could not even remember Bill Hulme’s name. He said he owed ‘someone called Bill’ £100,000. The Hulmes’ story was echoed by the boss of a high-tech firm who said he was cheated out of £250,000 by Caplin. The entrepreneur, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, told how Caplin boasted of his Tory links. ‘He would say things like, “I had lunch with George the other day.” He was definitely close to Osborne. He said “Theresa [Villiers] told me she wants one of your computers, but can she have it in pink?” Or he’d say, “I saw Oliver [Letwin] at the weekend.” He mentioned Cameron a couple of times.’ The businessman described how Caplin persuaded him to lend him £250,000 – which he is still waiting to get back. ‘I knew he had a senior job at the Tory Party and he was very plausible. He rang me in summer 2010 and asked to borrow £250,000 for a deal. I said, “No problem.” ‘A few weeks after that, he came to France with me. He phoned from Nice airport to say thanks. That was the last I heard from him. ‘When he was taken to court, he said he had money coming in, but he never did. He produced a cheque for £200,000 from a company in Northern Ireland. It was fake. He said he couldn’t attend court because he had a boil on his bum. It was ridiculous. ‘He is a Walter Mitty. He said he had a collection of vintage Fiat cars, but there is no trace of it. He is intelligent, but has a fatal flaw. Perhaps being too close to political power, and the need for money to maintain his position, affected his judgment. ‘Maybe he thought he could go bankrupt, conceal it, reinvent himself and get away with it. He nearly did – until you caught him out.’ When he appeared at the bankruptcy court, Caplin admitted that he paid money earned from his quango work into wife Angela’s bank account, which is also in the name  ‘A Caplin’. Asked why, he said it was ‘easier’ than using his account. This included his £6,000-a-year payment from the Medical Research Council. Last year he was reappointed as chairman of its finance committee by another Tory friend, Business Minister David Willetts, but he was sacked last week. Revelations: The question has been raised of why Caplin, pictured, was trusted with such a vast budget . Also paid into Mrs A Caplin’s account was the £20,000 a year he received as chairman of the North West London Hospitals NHS Trust. As he fought a losing battle to avoid bankruptcy, Caplin told the court that he was due to receive £63,000 in weeks from two US clients and $600,000 (£350,000) in two months from US firm Americana Investments. The money never materialised. He said he had been wealthy before the banking crash, but now had no stocks, shares or savings. His £1 million Cotswolds home had been repossessed by Barclays Bank, he said – and he still owed them £500,000. Prominent: Caplin at a previous event . Caplin’s current home is a penthouse apartment near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Kensington Palace in London. He told friends he bought it last year after selling the Cotswolds home and his £1.85 million home in Fulham. In fact, both were sold to pay off debts. And he does not own the apartment in Queen’s Gate. Land Registry records show it was purchased last July for £2.4 million by Raj Bansal and wife Urmila Mistry, British doctors practising in Florida. Caplin rents it for an estimated £7,000 a month – and is thought to be facing eviction for rent arrears. Seven years before his bankruptcy case, the London Stock Exchange publicly reprimanded an investment bank that Caplin chaired for breaking strict City rules. Durlacher bank and Prestbury Holdings, a ‘boutique bank’ chaired by Tory grandee Francis Maude, were both rapped after Durlacher advised Prestbury to delay announcing a profits warning. When it was finally issued, Prestbury’s shares fell nearly 75 per cent. Soon afterwards, Caplin contributed to the 2005 Conservative manifesto along with Mr Letwin. When Mr Maude became party chairman after the Election, he appointed Caplin as the Tories’ chief operating officer at Central Office. A spokesman for Mr Maude said: ‘Francis Maude did not meet Caplin until later, after the 2005 Election.’ Another of Caplin’s business associates is Ulster property developer Glenn Boyd who, in 2007, faced charges relating to a £1.2 million land deal, including transferring the proceeds of crime and possessing property as the proceeds of crime. Charges were dismissed, but he was struck off as a director until 2022. Caplin told his bankruptcy court in 2012 that Boyd was due to pay him £250,000 ‘later that day’ – and hoped to earn another £250,000 from him. It never arrived. Boyd confirmed that he has business links with Caplin, but refused to comment further. Caplin is one of two directors of HFX Globex Realisations, set up last October with Yvonne Anderson – Boyd’s wife – and registered to the couple’s former home in Londonderry. Questions to answer: It was Prime Minister David Cameron who made Caplin chairman of the major quango . Caplin is believed to have had the tables turned on him by falling  victim of a $2 billion Venezuelan bond fraud. He set up a company in the tax haven of the Isle of Man to receive millions of pounds in expected interest from investments, but Caplin told his bankruptcy hearing he ‘never received a penny and no bond was ever issued’. Caplin was discharged from bankruptcy just weeks before his appointment to the quango, but still owes money. Labour’s Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘The more we learn about this man, the more questions need to be answered.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Mr Caplin has not been a member of any donor club and we have no record of him attending any lunches with George Osborne.’ A Government spokesman said Caplin was made commissioner of the Public Works Loan Board after being nominated by the outgoing chairman of the independent board. Caplin was unavailable for comment.\n",
      "207. By . Sarah Harris . The head of one of the Coalition’s first free schools has been arrested by police investigating allegations of fraud. Sajid Raza was held in connection with a probe into the Kings Science Academy in Bradford which has been accused of ‘serious’ financial mismanagement. The 41-year-old, who set up the school in 2011, was bailed pending further inquiries. Poster boy: A file photo shows Prime Minister David Cameron meeting Kings Science Academy headteacher Sajid Raza in March 2012. Raza has been arrested and bailed amid allegations of 'serious' financial mismanagement . Last year, it was revealed that Kings Science Academy claimed tens of thousands of pounds in public money which was not used for its intended purposes amid allegations of financial irregularities and nepotism. An investigation by the Education Funding Agency found that the school had been given £86,335 in funding which had ‘not been used for its intended purpose’. It charged for first class travel, parties, buying furniture for staff and allegedly submitted ‘fabricated invoices’ to the Department for Education for rent it did not actually pay. The revelation was a huge embarrassment for the Government and followed a series of controversies about free schools - state funded institutions set up independently of local authorities. Kings Science Academy - which boasts Tory vice chair, Alan Lewis, as its executive patron - was among the first wave of free schools. It was visited and praised by Prime Minister, David Cameron, in 2012. Detective Superintendent Lisa Griffin, head of crime for Bradford district, said yesterday: ‘As part of West Yorkshire Police’s ongoing investigation into matters at Kings Science Academy, Bradford, a 41-year-old man has today been arrested at premises in Bradford and is currently being questioned in relation to suspected fraud offences.’ The Department for Education said it sparked the police probe by referring the school to the UK’s national fraud reporting centre, Action Fraud, after receiving allegations of wrongdoing. A DfE spokesman said: ‘The department acted as soon as it received allegations of wrongdoing at Kings Science Academy. We formally investigated and referred the case to Action Fraud. ‘This resulted in a police investigation which is ongoing. Separately we are recovering appropriate funds. ‘All free schools are held to rigorous account. The vast majority are performing well with three-quarters rated good or outstanding. But where there is failure we will not hesitate to intervene.’ Pupils leave Kings Science Academy, Bradford, yesterday: An investigation by the Education Funding Agency found that the school had been given £86,335 in funding which had 'not been used for its intended purpose' Liberal Democrat Bradford East MP David Ward welcomed yesterday’s developments in the police investigation. Mr Ward has raised a series of questions about the management of the academy and the role of Tory vice chair, Mr Lewis, who also owns the land the school is built on. Last week, in the Commons, Mr Ward asked Education Secretary Michael Gove what steps his department was taking. Mr Gove said he had to careful not the prejudice the police investigation . Mr Ward replied: ‘That is disappointing, because of course the head of a maintained school would have been on his bike long ago.’ Labour MP Kevin Brennan asked the Secretary of State: ‘Mr Lewis is not just a benefactor; he is a landlord who will receive £12million in rent in years to come from the school, as well as a vice-chair of the Conservative Party and a major Tory donor. ‘Is that anything to do with the fact that the Secretary of State has refused to take any action whatsoever against anyone since this scandal broke?’ Mr Gove replied: ‘It is important to place on the record the fact that Mr Lewis is receiving for the property an appropriately guaranteed market rent - less than he was receiving for it beforehand.’ The Secretary of State defended his department’s handling of the case and said: ‘The law must follow its course.’ Last October, the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was threatened with closure after Ofsted criticised it as ‘dysfunctional’. In December, the Discovery New School in Crawley, West Sussex, was axed amid ‘continued inadequate teaching’. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
      "208. By . Associated Press . Updated: . 15:15 EST, 12 January 2012 . Prosecutors say Kenneth Shong founded a fake university while in prison. If convicted, Shong ¿ whose criminal past dates back two decades and includes fleeing the U.S. ¿ could face up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine . A con man is accused of starting a fake university and churning out fake diplomas – while in prison. Kenneth Shong, 45, who is currently serving time in a Wisconsin prison appeared in court on Tuesday to face a fraud charge, years after the complex scheme was uncovered. He is alleged to have worked with associates outside the prison walls to operate a suspected diploma mill that was recruiting students for at least two years before investigators caught on. Shong, described by a judge in 2005 as having a history of 'outwitting, outplaying and outlasting authorities,' was set to be released from prison last Saturday on a forgery conviction. He was instead taken into custody and charged Thursday with fraudulent writings in Winnebago County. A hearing to determine whether he will stand trial is scheduled for Jan. 19. His public defender, Katena Roberts-Turner, did not immediately return a call for comment Tuesday. If convicted, Shong – whose criminal past dates back two decades and includes fleeing the US – could face up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. According to the criminal complaint, Shong was at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in 2006 when he encouraged another inmate, Kenneth Fleming, who wanted to become a paralegal, to enroll in 'Carlingford University.' Shong allegedly said the school was accredited, incorporated in Delaware and Alabama and degrees were granted through their London campus. Fleming later arranged for his mother to send a $1,740 tuition payment to a post office box in Mobile, Alabama. Back in the clink: Shong was already in prison for fraud and tax evasion charges. He faces up to six more years behind bars . The complaint said the inmate became suspicious of 'poor business practices and unresponsiveness' in relation to the school returning his grades and giving further lessons. The inmate later learned the university was not incorporated in Delaware and Alabama and complained to the state in 2008. Two other inmates from the Oshkosh prison also complained about the 'university' and Shong, who has several aliases, including Kenneth Onapolis, investigators said. The complaint also noted that Carlingford University's website had statements that were misleading and erroneous. Shong also had convicted sex offender David Kaster, whom he met in prison, help him start a post office box in Green Bay after Kaster was released that Shong used to claim he had a Green Bay \"Regional Training Center,\" according to the complaint. Shong transferred to the Racine Correctional Institution in the fall 2007, and officials there began getting suspicious of his activities and started to investigate. The Wisconsin Educational Approval Board determined that Carlingford University was operating in Wisconsin without necessary approval, and issued a cease-and-desist order. The Department of Justice's investigation is ongoing. Charges took so long because the case was complex and was recently reassigned to a new prosecutor, said Justice Department spokeswoman Dana Brueck. Shong's criminal past includes convictions for bank fraud, theft and other financial crimes. After years on the run, he was captured in 2002 by US marshals in Vanuatu, a small island near Australia, and returned to the US to face federal fraud and tax evasion charges. When that prison term ended, Wisconsin authorities brought him back to finish serving a 12-year sentence on a 1989 sentence on forgery charges. He had escaped while on parole in 1993. At a court hearing in 1989, Dane County prosecutor Ann Sayles said Shong used fake checks, obtained bank credit to buy an expensive car, and defrauded companies to buy plane tickets under a fake name. She called him 'a professional con man' and said his shady business activities were continuing in jail. 'I'm not so certain the public is safe even with him in prison,' she said.\n",
      "209. By . Daily Mail Reporter . Distress: Janet Milliken was left 'disturbed' after learning her home was the site of a murder-suicide . A woman has appealed to the state Supreme Court after a home seller and real estate agent allegedly failed to tell her a murder-suicide had taken place in the home they sold her. When Janet Milliken, 59, moved from California to Thornton, Pennsylvania in 2007, she was unaware that the new house she had bought for $610,000 had been the site of two deaths a year earlier. Only when she moved in and began chatting to the neighbours did she learn of her new home's grisly past - and the discovery left her disturbed, according to the lawsuit. She sued the sellers, Joseph and Kathleen Jacono,  and the real estate agent, Re/Max, for fraud and misrepresentation, claiming they deliberately hid what had occurred at the home. But the trial judge ruled in favour . of the defendants, saying state law does not require agents to disclose . such facts, ABC News reported. Last month, the state appeals court agreed with the . decision. According to the . opinion penned by President Judge Emeritus Kate Ford Elliot, sellers are . only required to identify structural, hazardous and legal impairments . to a property. The opinion . noted the Jaconos and their Realtors sought advice from the Pennsylvania . Real Estate Commission and were told they did not need to disclose the . murder-suicide. 'If . psychological defects must be disclosed, then we are not far from . requiring sellers to reveal that a next-door neighbor is loud and . obnoxious, or on some days you can smell a nearby sewage plant, or that . the house was built on an old Indian burial ground,' the opinion said. Scene: The Thornton, Pennsylvania home where a man shot his wife before turning the gun on himself . Now Milliken has filed a petition to the Supreme Court of . Pennsylvania to continue her battle. Her . attorney Tim Rayne told ABC News that they want to make the state . realise 'that having a horrific event occur within a property can be . just as damaging and troubling to a future homeowner as a physical . defect, or perhaps even more so.' He added: 'Having a gunshot . murder-suicide committed within the home is much more devastating than . having a small leak concealed by the previous homeowner. 'Physical defects can be fixed. Troubling events that could and did . occur in this home could never go away.' The battle stems from February 11, 2006, when Konstantinos Koumboulis shot and killed his wife, then shot himself dead in the master bedroom of the Pickering Trail home, which they owned. Their three young children were at home at the time, but were not harmed. On February 11, 2006, 50-year-old Konstantinos Koumboulis shot and killed his 34-year-old wife, Georgia. He then turned the gun on himself and shot himself dead in the master bedroom of the home, which they owned. Their three children, aged seven to 13, were at home at the time, but were not harmed. Police said the eldest child called 911 and the bodies were found around 8.30 a.m. After authorities arrived on the scene, the children were taken to state police barracks, where they were met by family. Their home went to auction. Eight months later the Jaconos, who knew about the killings, bought the home for $450,000 and later sold it to Milliken. She moved in with her two teenage children after her husband's death. Rayne said Milliken, 59, was 'disturbed' when she found out the history of the home. As she wondered how to tell her children, they learned of the deaths from their friends. 'They were very upset upon learning about it and disturbed about the whole situation,' Rayne said. 'They were dealing with the death of a . father and husband and wanted to move closer to family, and then this . happened to them. It was a tragedy all around.' The family is still living at the home as they cannot afford to move out. If they were to leave, they would have to tell the new buyers about the home's history 'through good conscience', which would affect the value, Rayne said. As . he dissented to December's Superior Court decision, Judge John T. Bender acknowledged the massive loss the family had suffered. 'The financial . penalty Mrs. Milliken has suffered was entirely avoidable had the . sellers whom she bought her home merely exercised a little more . integrity and a little less greed,' he said. But Abraham Reich, the attorney for the Jaconos, said: 'The majority, en banc [full-court] opinion of the Superior Court was well reasoned and consistent with years of industry practice in Pennsylvania. 'The Superior Court opinion provides guidance for any real estate transaction in the future and puts to rest the uncertainty of whether a seller has a duty to disclose a murder-suicide or any other type \"psychological damage\". In my opinion, the result is a good one.'\n",
      "210. By . Chris Greenwood . The U.S. Justice Department has filed papers accusing Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, as being the leader of the gang behind the software . Computer users were last night warned to take urgent action to protect themselves from a global cyber virus pandemic. Police across the globe launched an unprecedented attack on high-tech criminals behind software, called Gameover Zeus, causing misery to millions. FBI investigators say the virus has infected between 500,000 and one million computers in 12 countries, which will likely cost millions to national economies. 'Gamover Zeus is the most sophisticated botnet the FBI and our allies have ever attempted to disrupt,' said FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert Anderson. But the grip of those behind the so-called ‘malware’ has been weakened by a counter attack on the servers which control the software. The Australian Federal Police assisted the FBI with the operation against the Gameover Zeus botnet. 'The AFP can confirm it has been involved in operational activity supporting the FBI disruption action against the ‘Gameover Zeus’ botnet,' said a spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police. 'The AFP continues to urge individuals to ensure they have the most up to date anti-virus software to protect themselves from malicious software,' the spokesperson said. Those who fail to install anti-virus software risk having their valuable data, including precious photographs, music and personal files held to ransom. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained by the criminal network. Gameover Zeus has spread worldwide but has been temporarily disabled by the international effort by law enforcement agencies. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers can rebuild their network. The international effort by forces including the NCA, Interpol and Europol, targeted the ‘command and control’ servers behind the virus. Hackers will be able to install new ones, but it is thought that there will be a window of opportunity of at least two weeks for computer users to protect themselves. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. The software installs itself on a computer when the victim clicks on a link in an unsolicited email or via a website. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained . Could Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic? He is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic. But the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and ‘slavik’. The 31-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as ‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online banking accounts. The FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009. Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname ‘lucky12345’ by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on a number of charges including Bank Fraud, Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Aggravated Identity Theft. On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy, Computer Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud and Money Laundering. Then just days ago on May 30, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘lucky12345’ to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud. He is described as white with brown hair (though his head is usually shaved) and brown eyes. He is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds (82kg). Bogachev was last known to live in Anapa, Russia. He is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. It then sends out more emails to lure further victims, without the knowledge of the computer users, and spreads quickly across the internet. The virus lays dormant until it spots an opportunity to steal personal details such as online banking information and passwords. It then transmits this information back to the criminal network who use it to drain the victim’s accounts. In a further twist, if the user is not a ‘viable’ victim then the software locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom. At the moment the software demands one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals, which is around £300. The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files. The software can lock the information on a computer and hold it to ransom - one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals, which is around $500. File picture . Last night, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers accusing a Russian named Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev as being the leader of the gang behind the software. The complaint claims the software has been responsible for the loss of more than $100m from individuals and a string of major companies. Andy Archibald, of the NCA, said: ‘Nobody wants their personal financial details, business information or photographs of loved ones to be stolen or held to ransom by criminals. ‘By making use of this two-week window, huge numbers of people in the UK can stop that from happening to them. ‘Whether you find online security complicated or confusing, or simply haven’t thought about keeping your personal or office computers safe for a while, now is the time to take action. ‘Our message is simple: update your operating system and make this a regular occurrence, update your security software and use it and, think twice before clicking on links or attachments in unsolicited emails.’ Computer users who fear they could fall victim to the virus are advised to install anti-virus software and ensure their operating system has the latest security updates. It is thought that the gang first check if a target’s keyboard is in Russian and only strike if it is another language. Eunice Power is one British victim who has been blackmailed by the cyber criminals. After corrupting files on her computer, the gang offered to fix the problem for several hundred pounds. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers - whose attempts have been temporarily thwarted - can rebuild their network. The US Department of Homeland Security urged users to install anti-virus software on their computer and ensure that the latest operating systems were also installed on their computers. If systems do not offer automatic updates, people should enable it. The department also advised changing passwords, as original passwords may have been compromised during the infection. The National Crime Agency advised computer users to consult the Government-backed getsafeonline.org website. From that website, computer users can download tailored anti-virus software which has been provided for free by eight companies. Symantec also advised computer users to review all their bank and credit card statements for irregularities. It also advised being cautious when handling unsolicited or unexpected emails, particularly during the two-week window before hackers rebuild their network. Experts have also warned users to back-up all valuable data. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. Miss Power, a chef who runs a business from home, told Channel 4 News: ‘I could actually feel perspiration coming out through me. ‘I lost everything: family photographs, recipes, payroll, my accounts package. It was devastating.’ The attack was so complex that an external storage unit that was connected to the computer at the time was targeted by the gang, preventing Miss Power from accessing it. AEV Ltd, a varnish factory in Birkenhead, was hit with ‘utter disaster’ when the criminals hacked into the company’s bank account to fake two payments costing £100,000. The criminals created two fake payment pages and tricked an employee of the company into authorising them. Managing director Jonathan Kemp said: ‘It started out as a normal day and ultimately by the afternoon in a period of three minutes we were £100,000 down.’ The FBI called the alleged ringleader, 30-year-old Evgeniy Bogachev, one of the most prolific cyber criminals in the world and issued a 'Wanted' poster, pictuted, that lists his online monikers and describes him as a boating enthusiast . Although the company was refunded by the bank, Mr Kemp said he spoke to other companies who had been hit by the scam, accumulating their losses at £3.5 million. Stewart Garrick, from the National Cyber Crime Unit, said that solicitor firms, police stations in America and academic institutions had been targeted. Charlie McMurdie, former head of the national ecrime unit, described the threat as a ‘cyber plague’ and warned that it could also be used to target mobile phones. She said: ‘Once one of these plagues is released everybody will pick up on it, adapt it and people around the world will be using these sorts of virus to carry out crime. ‘It’s not just computers, this kind of malware is now being hitting our mobile phones.’ ‘It can have a significant impact on individuals and companies.’ She said that the virus ‘had been known about for a long period of time’ and said that warnings about the virus had been issued over the last few months.\n",
      "211. By . Sam Webb . Fraud: Nicola Daly, 39, has to pay back a nine-year, £100k fraud with £50 a week - which will take her 178 years . A benefits cheat has been given 178 years to pay back the money she swindled from taxpayers. Nicola Daly claimed £100,000 in council tax, housing benefit and income support payments for almost nine years. Today Daly, of Tilehurst, Berkshire, was starting a 16-month jail sentence for the fraud which was only discovered after her elderly mother-in-law inadvertently revealed the deception it with a residential care application. A judge heard that Daly claimed the cash after lying to her local council that she was raising her two children alone. In fact the cheat had lived with her partner, who worked for John Lewis, for several years and continued to do so despite repeatedly claiming she had been estranged from him for 15 years. The trickster was finally caught after her elderly mother-in-law applied for residential care and declared that she owned a house where her son Steven Randall and Daly both lived. The 39-year-old was sentenced to 16 months in prison at Reading Crown Court after admitting five charges of fraud and making false statements. The court heard she is repaying the amount at a rate of £50 a month, which will take a staggering 178 years for the total to be recovered. Alison Ginn prosecuting, said: 'Between June 2004 and March 2013, very nearly nine years, Daly claimed and received benefits in the form of income support, housing support and council tax benefits to which she was not entitled. 'The total amount she received was £107,154 and 50p,' she said. 'She was representing that she was a single parent living with her children when in fact she lived with their father, Steven Randall, who was employed from June 2004 at John Lewis in Bracknell, Berkshire.' Reading Crown Court, where Daly was given a 16-month jail sentence for the fraud . The court heard that Daly had clearly stated on benefit claim forms to Reading Borough Council that she only lived with her two children, now aged five and 11 years. Mrs Ginn said: 'Reading Borough Council requested more information and she said that she was not in contact with Steven Randall and he had not paid any maintenance for his children.' She added in subsequent claims that she had not spoken the man she lived with for 15 years. 'It all came to light when Mr Randall's mother, Ivy, completed an application for people seeking residential care, on which she said she jointly owned a premises with her son, who lived there with his partner and children,' said Mrs Ginn. 'Mr Randall's wages were being paid into this defendant's bank account, the same one into which her benefits were paid.' The trickster was finally caught after her elderly mother-in-law applied for residential care and declared that she owned a house where her son Steven Randall and Daly both lived . When Daly was questioned by police in March 2013, she lied and said the father of her children was Mr Randall's brother Darren. She claimed to have never been in a relationship with Mr Randall and said his wages were only paid into her account as he had debt problems. However, she requested a second interview a month later and admitted her web of lies, telling police she lied as she 'thought she could get away with it'. Graham Bennett, mitigating, said Daly had some previous convictions but none for over a decade. He said that at the time of the initial false claim, she and her partner had struggled with drug addictions and she had just given birth to their first child. 'She was in significant financial difficulties,' said Mr Bennett. 'The income support gave rise to council tax and housing benefit and the same false declarations were made. Regrettably she did not correct matters and this continued throughout the years.' He said the couple had married in April this year and Daly was working part-time to repay her debt at £50 per month. 'It is not a repayment that is going to be dealt with swiftly but her intent is to repay as much as possible,' said Mr Bennett. He asked Judge Johannah Cutts to consider a suspended prison sentence due to the difficulty a custodial term would present to her young family. Judge Cutts said she recognised that 'life had been difficult' for Daly in 2004 and commended her for beating her drug addiction, but condemned her lies. 'Social securities support is not to pay people who feel hard up, it doesn't come from a limitless supply of cash,' she said. 'Taxpayers money is used in a benevolent society to help those truly in need and you did not fall into that category.' Sentencing Daly to 16 months in prIson, she added: 'It is often the families of those who commit crimes who suffer the most.' Three related charges, which Daly denied, were left to lay on file by the Crown Prosecution Service.\n",
      "212. By . Katy Winter . When Lenny Walters informed his bank that his wife had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he discovered a horrifying secret: she had taken out two loans against their house, racking up £48,000 worth of debt. Joyce died six years ago, just months after Lenny found out about her betrayal. The widower from Pembrokeshire now faces losing his house to the bank and has delayed his retirement to stay on top of the debt. Tragically, he says that he can never forgive her. Scroll down for video . Lenny Walter appeared on ITV This Morning with his daughter Katy to talk about his devastating discovery . It was only when Lenny offered to take over the family finances after his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer that he discovered the secret debt . Speaking on ITV’s This Morning with his daughter Katy, Lenny, 62, said: ‘It was six months after diagnosis that I discovered it, only because I said I was going to take over the finances because she wasn’t well. ‘I shouldn’t have said anything because then I wouldn’t have known anything about it until after she passed away. The day after I said I would take control of the finances she did a runner. ‘I only had said I would pay the bills and the next day she was gone because she knew I would find out.' ‘I found out that I was massively in debt by £48,000.' Lenny’s wife had taken out loans against the value of their home, redirecting mail from the bank to a resource centre where she worked to hide the issue from her husband. Her fraud involved her forging his signature twice to take out the loans. After her lies were discovered, Joyce fled the family home, moving in with her niece, miles away in Stanwell, Surrey. Lenny didn't see his wife again until he went to visit her in hospital on her death bed. Despite the huge amount of money spent, Lenny says he has no idea why Joyce needed it. Katy says she believes her mother's spending habits and Bingo playing created the debt . ‘I have no idea. We were solvent, we were both working. The kids had left home and we had a low mortgage, if any.’ However, daughter Katie suspects a combination of Bingo debts and overspending over years may have been to blame. ‘She had always been an over spender, she’d always buy two of everything. Because it had been that way for years you didn’t question it. ‘When she died she was living with me and I found loads of clothes with tags on that she hadn’t even worn. She just kept buying and buying.’ Despite receiving a letter of apology from Joyce  Lenny, who now faces losing his home, says he cannot forgive her . Lenny has battled with the bank for years in attempt to stay in the family home but faces losing it, and with it his children’s inheritance, in a forced sale to repay the debt. A month after Lenny, who works as a fisherman, discovered the financial problems he received a letter from Joyce, in which she wrote: ‘I know you must hate me, and who can blame you. You are a hard working man, loving and kind and a heart of gold, you made me a very happy woman and now I have left you because of money. 'This is all my fault not yours, I was spending far too much and it got out of control and I just didn’t know how to get out of it.’ But despite this apology and having been married for nearly 30 years, Lenny says that he still cannot forgive his wife, who died age 56. ‘I can’t forgive her intent, wanting to do that to me. If you’re married for 30 years  you don’t do that. That’s your best mate. ‘I gave her everything and she gave me everything - we had a good marriage. I don’t understand what happened.’\n",

One of Britain’s top black lawyers was today jailed for stealing £75,000 from his clients to prop up his diamond business. Michael Webster, 49, took tens of thousands of pounds from the client account of his firm Webster Dixon LLP, which made history as first company founded by black lawyers in the City of London. He then funnelled the cash into the account of a business associate who hoped to make money on diamonds in Ghana. When . the deal failed to go through, he tried to take out a loan to cover . the loss, but was arrested after his bookkeeper spotted discrepancies in his accounts. Today Webster, a former chairman of the Black Solicitors Network, has been jailed for eight months after pleading guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position at London's Old Bailey. The court heard that the lawyer had made four withdrawals totalling £75,605.57 from the client account at Webster Dixon LLP between December 3, 2012, and February 1, 2013. Leee Ingham, prosecuting, said the law firm had been in financial difficulty at the time. He told the court: ‘What Webster was really doing was speculating with someone else’s money. The firm was suffering financially and that is the primary motivation.’ He added that the diamond deal had, in fact, turned out to be an advance fee fraud operated by criminals in Ghana. Webster, a former lawyer at Lehman Brothers International, set up his own firm in 1998 after four years as a partner at Conway & Co. Solicitors. He was named in the Lawyer Magazine ‘Hot 100’ in 2004 and described as ‘one of an influential new generation’ of lawyers. In July that year, he was elected as a . Council Member of the Law Society and the following year, he joined the . board of the City of London Law Society. Shamed: Webster (above) took tens of thousands of pounds from the client account of his firm Webster Dixon LLP. He then funnelled the cash into the account of an associate who hoped to make money on diamonds . In November 2007, Webster was elected chairman of the Black Solicitors Network, the largest organisation for minority lawyers in Europe. He also spent four years as secretary for the Society of Black Lawyers. Tyrone Smith, defending, told the court that Webster's good character and references from dozens of fellow lawyers, including a former President of the Law Society, meant he should be spared jail. He said: ‘This man has been broken by his conduct. He will never be able to . practise in the job he loves, his standing amongst his friends is . indelibly stained by his actions. Firm: Webster Dixon LLP (above) made history as first company founded by black lawyers in the City of London . He has brought the good name of his family into disrepute. There is not a day that goes by that he doesn’t consider it.’ He added that the lawyer had always . intended for the money to be returned to the client account once the diamond . deal had been successful. ‘The firm stood to receive significant . fees for the success of the deal,’ he said. ‘This is not a case where . there is a simple taking of clients’ money to enrich the defendant.’ But Judge Nic Madge told Webster that his behaviour had been so serious that he had no option but to send him to prison. He told me: 'You abused a position of trust not just as a solicitor but as a compliance officer for finance and administration in the firm. ‘I accept the motivation for the fraud was financial pressure. This is a personal tragedy for you and your family. ‘You have let yourself down, you have let your family down. You have let your professional partners and your clients down. You have thrown away what you have worked so very hard to achieve.’ Webster, from Streatham Hill, south London, was originally accused of plundering a total £104,000, but the prosecution later admitted the true figure was £75,605.57. He has already paid back £27,000 and has promised to repay the rest of the money. He also faces being struck off by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.\n",
      "214. By . Larisa Brown . A Ferrari-driving bully who plundered his wealthy lover’s estate after she disappeared has been found guilty of her murder. Donald Graham killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, so he could fund his lavish taste in supercars and buy his second mistress a home. Miss Brown vanished in 2005 and her body has never been found. He stole £300,000 of her savings, sold her Land Rover and Porsche with a personalised number plate, took her horses and tried to siphon off thousands of pounds from her estate and that of her family. Donald Graham, 59, has been found guilty of killing his lover Janet Brown, 45, and hiding her body before trying to strip her and her elderly parents of all their assets . Ms Brown (left), a wealthy heiress, went missing before she was due to go on holiday in 2005. Graham (right) killed her, hid her body, then sent fake postcards from France pretending to be her and saying she had a job . He also spun a cruel web of lies that left Miss Brown’s parents believing she was still alive. After . a seven-week trial at  Newcastle Crown Court, Graham was found guilty . of her murder and perverting the course of  justice yesterday. After the verdict, police called on Graham, nicknamed ‘Dodgy Don’, to tell Miss Brown’s family what he had done with her body. Detective . Chief Inspector Nicola Musgrove, of Northumbria Police, said: ‘Graham . is a controlling and manipulative man, particularly towards women; a . bully who deliberately instils fear into people and uses intimidating . behaviour to get his own way. ‘He is a callous man who made it look like Janet was alive when in fact he had, motivated by financial greed, murdered her.’ Graham, 60, described as ‘flash’ and always ‘dripping in gold’, had lived with his wife Denise, 66, but had two mistresses. Donald gained the trust of Ms Brown's elderly and ill parents, stole their bank details, and after their deaths he plundered their estate using it to pay for fast cars (pictured, Graham's Ferrari) Graham was on trial with another lover, Elizabeth Todd (right), accused of making a fake will signing Ms Brown's family farm over to him. The jury were unable to reach a verdict on Todd, 51 (right) Last night an acquantaince of Graham, Elliot Stuart, 68, said: ‘People were frightened of him just because of his reputation. ‘When . we would go out he would park his car on double  yellow lines outside . restaurants, like he was in the gangster  movies. Nobody would ever stop . him or ask him to move. ‘His stepson told me he is a nasty man and made his life and his mother’s life a misery.’ 'Graham is a controlling and manipulative man, particularly towards women; a bully who deliberately instils fear... to get his own way' - Northumbria Police . Another . friend, and former partner of Miss Brown, known as Mick, said: ‘Janet . met Don through me. I serviced his cars, he had a Ferrari, a Porsche, . four-wheel drives, a Subaru Impreza. ‘He was polite, plausible, . well-educated but if he came and asked you for money you would give it . to him because he looked like he would pull your head off.’ Prosecutor Robert Smith, QC, told jurors that Graham’s lifestyle ‘didn’t match his income and his assets’. Graham . and Miss Brown, from Hexham, Northumberland, who had saved ‘substantial . assets’ of over £400,000, had been together for eight years. He told . her that his wife had cancer and when she died they would marry. The . pair arranged to go on holiday to France in 2005 but at the last minute . he pulled out, claiming his wife was unwell, so Miss Brown decided to go . alone. Despite repeated searches by police (pictured) Ms Brown's body has never been found. The court heard that Graham was her lover for eight years despite already being married . Nicola Musgrove, from Northumbria Police, said Graham should now admit what he has done with Ms Brown's body so that her family can be allowed to grieve . It was around the day of her intended departure on June 17 that . she was murdered. Her parents Olive and Eric Brown, a former accountant . who had ‘substantial’ savings, were led to believe she was living in . Europe after Graham sent a series of fake postcards and letters. They . died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was . working in a bank in Switzerland. The court heard that after booking . the holiday, Graham had found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, 51, with . whom he had become infatuated. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard that Graham and Ms Brown had been lovers for eight years despite the fact that Graham was already married . Jurors were told that Graham wanted . Miss Brown’s money so he could ‘live a lifestyle that involved owning . and driving powerful motor cars’ and buy a property for Todd to live in. His . downfall came in 2009 when one of the banks Eric Brown had an account . with suspected fraudulent activity and called in the police. Mr . Justice Openshaw said he would pass sentence today on Graham, who was . also convicted of perverting the course of justice and had admitted a . number of fraud charges. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on Todd . who was accused of fraud, forgery and jointly accused of perverting the . course of justice.\n",
      "215. By . Tara Brady . A husband has been left penniless after his dying wife secretly ran up £48,000 in debts to fritter away before she died. Devastated Lenny Walters, 56, discovered his wife Joyce had forged his signature twice to add cash to their joint mortgage. She died months after she confessed to the loans, forcing her husband of 29 years to sell the family home where they had lived for more than three decades, to cover the debt. Lenny Walters discovered his wife Joyce had forged his signature twice to add cash to their mortgage . Lenny Walters and wife Joyce Walters taken in 2000. Joyce died months after confessing to the loans . Fishmonger Lenny admitted he could not forgive or forget her betrayal despite the fact the love of his life was on her death bed. He said: 'Words cannot describe the pain I felt when the full scale of her betrayal unfolded. 'Even as she was dying, I couldn’t accept her apology. It was the worst moment of my life. Joyce was well loved in our community and I trusted her implicitly. 'To think she could do this to me was beyond comprehension. We’d been together for 33 years. 'This is a woman I shared half of my life with, who I thought I knew inside out and who I trusted implicitly. 'To think she could steal from me with such ease is hard to get my head round. I couldn’t bring myself to forgive her even though she was dying of cancer.' Lenny believed they were close to paying off the £30,000 mortgage on their three-bed, semi-detached in Pembrokeshire, when his wife was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007. Joyce, 56, whose condition was terminal, underwent chemotherapy in a bid to prolong her life but the cancer had also spread into her bone and brain. Lenny Walters and wife Joyce Walters taken in late 1990s. The couple had been married for 33 years . Photograph of Joyce Walters taken in 1980s: Her husband Lenny said he could not forgive her . Heartbroken Lenny decided to inform their provider Lloyds Bank as the couple had a joint account, although Joyce organised the mortgage repayments, which cost £350-a-month. However, on the day of Lenny’s trip to the bank he received a bombshell text from Joyce admitting to her deceit, before she fled to live with her niece in Surrey. Lenny said: 'Looking back, I think she knew what was coming. Finding out about the cancer was hard enough. 'I loved her just as much as the first day I met her and the thought of living without her was enough to kill me too. 'But when she dropped the bombshell about what she’d been up to at the bank. I was crushed. She texted me and confessed to re-mortgaging the property. 'I had no idea what was going on and couldn’t get any sense from Lloyds because she’d also changed our address, so the one I gave them wasn’t on their system. 'She told me she wouldn’t be coming back - that was it. She was dying and I’d have to fix this mess.'Lenny, who has a daughter, Katy, with Joyce, was showed statements that proved the property had been remortgaged in 2004 - adding a loan of £18,000. Joyce informed the bank that they had moved to a different address - which was actually the address of the resource centre where she worked. In May 2007, six months before she was diagnosed with cancer, she arranged a further £30,000 loan with Lloyds, secured against the value of the property. Lenny Walters, 62, a fishmonger from Milford Haven whose late wife remortgaged his house without his knowledge. Also pictured is his daughter Katy Walters, 33 . Despite the large value of the loan, no one queried that she had put a different address on her application form to their home address. When Lenny confronted his dying wife she confessed and even admitted that she 'fully expected to be pulled in [by police] for fraud', though she never was. A month latter Lenny received a letter from his heavily-medicated wife, reading: 'I know you must hate me, and who can blame you. 'You are a hard-working man, loving, kind and heart of gold. You made me a very happy woman and now I have lost you all because of money. 'This is all my fault not yours. I was spending far too much and it got out of control and I just didn’t know how to get out of it. I didn’t spend it on anything any good either. What a waste. 'I have nothing now. I am in the fight of my life with the cancer, and for the first time in my life I have never ever felt so alone.' In spite of the letter Lenny said he was unable to forgive his wife, who died five months after sending the apology. In April 2012, Lloyds Bank took Lenny to court in order to try to repossess the house. Lenny argued that he should not be penalised because of his wife’s actions because the bank should have been more vigilant in their checks. But despite accepting that he had nothing to do with the fraudulent activity, the bank will not accept any liability in the matter and are determined to recoup the money by forcing him to sell his property. He added: 'They want me to put the house up for auction with a reserve price of £45,000 for a quick sale. 'If I agree, they’ll also refund £3,000 for mis-sold PPI. 'I’ve already spent £10,000 of savings in legal fees but I’ll fight them to the bitter end to keep my home. I haven’t put it up for auction but it is on the market for £60,000. 'There are a lot of unanswered questions, like how she saw the same bank manager 14 times in the space of three years without me being present and how no one thought to query that she gave an address different to the home address. 'I’ve had years of stress fighting this case and, as far as I’m concerned, Lloyds need to be made answerable for their errors and lack of due diligence. 'The money I’d get from the house sale will be negligible. Lenny Walters said he is devastated that the woman he loved left him in such a financial mess . 'After spending 30 years of my life paying off a house, I’ll be forced to rent again, back to square one. 'I’ve always done the right thing and paid my way in life. I don’t think I should be penalised for my wife’s actions and Lloyds’ negligence. 'But the bank don’t care about my pain and distress and the fact that they are making me homeless. All they care about is recovering their money. They are completely heartless. 'And as for Joyce, I’m not sure I’ll ever understand how or why she could do this. I’m devastated that the woman I loved has left me this way.' A spokesman for Lloyds said: 'We are aware of Mr Walters’ case and are working with the customer to help reach a resolution. 'As discussions are still ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment in further detail about the case at this stage.'\n",
      "216. By . Mark Duell . Undertaker: Michael O'Brien, 59, is pictured arriving at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester . An undertaker was behind bars in disgrace today for swindling thousands of pounds out of the elderly as they planned their own funerals. Michael O'Brien, 59, mis-sold several funeral plans during his five years of scams and even pocketed cash donations left in envelopes by grieving well-wishers intended for charities. O’Brien - who also stole £1,000 which a grieving family had paid out for a headstone - was arrested after various complaints over his shady practises at his family firm Murray’s Funeral Services in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester. Police raided the funeral parlour last October to find a large haul of cheques dating back to 2005 which well-wishers had asked to be forwarded into charities including Macmillan Cancer Support and the British Heart Foundation. Cash donations were never received by the intended recipients. Human ashes were also seized by police and handed to council officials who stored them at a nearby crematorium. Inquiries revealed O’Brien, who owned a number of funeral homes over the last 30 years, carried out the frauds after his business which was previously run by his father ran into difficulty. At Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, he hung his head in shame as he was jailed for eight months after admitting three charges of fraud and nine offences under consumer protection regulations. Judge Andrew Lowcock told O’Brien: ‘It’s very sad to see you in the dock of the crown court. You had, prior to these events, led a blameless life. Yet you conned people at their most vulnerable whether through age, illness or bereavement. Trying to support your business is not an excuse for this behaviour.’ Earlier the court heard how O’Brien’s firm was already sliding into bankruptcy when he targeted elderly people who did not want to burden surviving relatives with their funeral costs. Four victims including an elderly couple aged 86 and 92 agreed to pay between £2,300 to £3,000 each for funeral plans not realising they were worthless as they were not backed by any insurance. They were also unaware O’Brien was not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority due to his financial difficulties. Intended recipient: Between September and December 2013 at least £800 was donated to the British Heart Foundation in memory of two men who died. None of the donations were ever received . It meant families didn’t realise they would lose their money once O’Brien’s business went bankrupt in January 2013, meaning no funds were available for customers seeking refunds. One widower who took out a £3,019 plan with O’Brien after his wife died, tried to get a refund after getting a deal with Age UK - only to get nothing. Another family paid out almost £5,000 to O’Brien including £1,080 for a headstone in memory of a retired builder who died aged 64 of cancer. The funeral went ahead but no headstone materialised. O’Brien was called in by police for interview but said he could not attend because he was in hospital. Failure to attend another interview forced officers to contact the hospital to find out he was not currently a patient there and he was arrested at home where officers found paperwork relating to the charity donations. During inquiries police discovered between June 2010 and February 2013 O’Brien had received donations totalling £945 intended for Macmillan Cancer Support. In February 2011 he had received £190 worth of donations for Tameside General Hospital in memory of a local lady who died. And between September and December 2013 at least £800 was donated to the British Heart Foundation in memory of two men who died. None of the donations were ever received. Prosecutor Miss Leila Ghahhary said: ‘These persons were vulnerable, through age, infirmity or bereavement. In addition the victims have suffered stress and anxiety. ‘In selling the funeral plans, the defendant falsely advised them that there would be insurance to back them up. In fact none of the plans had security and were effectively worthless. Kept the money: In February 2011 he had received £190 worth of donations for Tameside General Hospital (pictured) in memory of a local lady who died . ‘He took money from plans when he knew his business was in difficulty and been made bankrupt. In 2005 his father and business partner had died and the defendant ran into financial difficulty. ‘In 2011 he had difficulties with various loans and credit cards. Since the death of his father he was incapable of keeping up the finances, robbing Peter to pay Paul and to meet his financial commitments.’ The court heard the cost of the frauds totalled £13,234 with the total sum of mis-sold funeral plans - £10,219, the cost of the head stone £1,080 and the total known sum of charity donations - £1,935 of which £530 was cash. 'You conned people at their most vulnerable whether through age, illness or bereavement. Trying to support your business is not an excuse for this behaviour' Judge Andrew Lowcock . The court heard O’Brien always provided a funeral but the money he received for the plans went into propping up his business and not into the holding accounts of customers. In mitigation for O’Brien, defence Simeon Evans said: ‘He has never been in trouble previously and was considered a pillar of the community - both him and his father before him. He provided funerals as affordable as possible. ‘He would have done everything in his power to provide funerals for the people in this case. ‘He had always intended to pay these cash sums across to the various charities. He instead used them to pay for the day to day running, for the funerals he was contracted for. ‘His financial situation has been disastrous for many years. He would say he is a very good undertaker and a very bad business man.’ But after the case Fiona Smith, 39, who was never provided with a headstone for her late father Francis Hancock, 64, said: ‘We trusted him completely. Seeing this man jailed is justice for my dad. It was his money. He would have been fuming.’ Ian Saxon, Tameside Council’s assistant executive director of environmental services, said ‘Mr O’Brien caused a great deal of misery and heartache for a number of individuals and families who have suffered financial loss as result of his fraudulent actions.’\n",
      "217. By . Ashley Collman . The 47-year-old Georgia pastor turned financial adviser who faked his own death after embezzling millions from his clients has spoken out to detail his 18 months on the run. Aubrey Lee Price went missing in June 2012 after sending suicide notes to his friends and family and boarding a ferry from Key West to Fort Meyers, Florida. Though his body was never found, the married father-of-four was officially pronounced dead six months later, believed to have jumped off the ferry and died in the ocean. But Price stayed on the boat and started a new life before he was arrested on December 31, 2013, after cops pulled him over in Brunswick, Georgia because the tint on his car was too dark. In an interview with Esquire, Price has revealed that he initially planned to commit suicide when he boarded the ferry, and that he had no plan for his new life after deciding to stay on the boat. Before and after: Aubrey Lee Price faked his own death in June 2012 after embezzling millions from his clients. In an interview with Esquire, Price details his 18 months on the run. Pictured on the left before his disappearance, and in a mugshot after his December 2013 arrest . 'I don’t know why I didn’t kill myself,' Price said. 'Once it got dark on that boat and no one was there, I threw everything over except the backpack with my driver’s license and wedding ring. 'I threw all my credit cards away. I had, like, eighteen dollars left to my name after paying for postage at the Key West post office and paying the taxicab driver.' After landing back in Florida, he traveled to South America where he worked for a former business associate in Venezuela. While Price says he only interacted with his friend's legal business before, when he returned to South America he started helping the man with his illegal cocaine smuggling business. In the interview, Price describes the moment his friend revealed his drug business by showing him his warehouse 'stuffed full of coke'. He ended up working in the drug smuggling business for a while, before eventually moving back to the U.S. Abandoned: Price left behind four children and wife Rebekah (pictured) when he faked his suicide. He is currently serving a 30 year prison sentence . Price talked about missing his children but used emotional language to describe being separated from his dog. 'I longed to be with my dog again, a golden retriever named Holly Jolly. I probably won’t see my dog ever again. And she was my best friend,' he said. Back in the U.S., Price downloaded software to make fake IDs and says he had about six false identities including both foreign and local aliases. During that time, he says he went by several names including Diesel, Gator, Javier, and Jason. He spent some of his time missing cage-fighting in New York, which is also how he developed a love for marijuana which he says he took to relieve body pain. Over 200 marijuana plants were later discovered at the home he was renting in Georgia. He managed to stay off the street by rooming with prostitutes in motels, but maintains he was chaste the whole time. Green: Price says he started using marijuana after becoming a cage-fighter. Over 200 plants were discovered in the home he rented in Georgia, after his arrest . Price says one of the most disappointing aspects of faking his death, was learning his FBI reward was just $20,000. 'I was disappointed in the reward for me—it was only $20,000! I was on the FBI’s top ten list! Come on, put some money out there! I wanted to be number one,' he said. But Price says it was tough keeping the charade up, and he didn't like his life on the run. He was driving his car the day he got cut, and happened to have a bit of an emotional crisis behind the wheel. 'I was beating my steering wheel, angry at God. I felt like I wasn’t making any progress towards restitution. 'I’m riding up I-95. And I remember saying, Lord, where are you? I said that, like, ten times. And then I looked up and there were blue lights behind me. I said, Thanks, Lord. That’s where you are. 'So I pulled over eighteen months after I disappeared. And that was it.' Following his arrest, Price plead guilty to fraud charges and is now serving a 30 year prison sentence. He has also been ordered to pay $51million in restitution to the clients he defrauded.\n",
      "218. By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Police are under pressure to question the multi-millionaire founder of Wonga, Errol Damelin (pictured), over his role in the decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers . Police are under pressure to question the multi-millionaire founder of Wonga, Errol Damelin, over his role in the decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers. Mr Damelin stepped down from the payday loan giant two weeks ago as the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority(FCA), prepared to issue a damning judgment on Wonga’s treatment of customers. The South African businessman founded Wonga in 2007 and was chief executive at the time the company invented two law firms and sent threatening letters to 45,000 customers who were behind on repayments. Despite this, he has walked away from the company with a personal fortune estimated at more than £34million and without suffering any sanction. The FCA has ordered Wonga to pay compensation of some £2.6million to the customers involved, which is pocket money to the wealthy company and works out at flat rate of just £50 each. But that has left consumer groups and MPs demanding to know why Mr Damelin and Wonga have not been investigated under a series of possible criminal offences. Earlier this week, sources at the FCA indicated that the City of London Police were asked to investigate Wonga’s activities by its predecessor, the Office of Fair Trading(OFT), last year and they decided not to take any action. However, this has been denied by the police, while Wonga says the company and its executives were never contacted by officers. There are a number of potential offences which Wonga may have committed including a breach of The Solicitors Act of 1974, which makes it an offence for someone to falsely claim to be a solicitor. There is also the Administration of Justice Act, which make it a crime to harass debtors, as well as the Fraud Act and the Theft Act. Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group said: ‘Clearly there are a very large number of victims.  Each one has been mugged by Wonga. ‘It seems to me that no-one – not the OFT, the Financial Services Authority, not the FCA or the police have focussed on the effect upon the victims and the sheer scale of what has gone on.‘ . Investigations should be carried out. Apart from who knew what was going on - who came up with the idea?  Who . approved it?  Who put it into action? ‘Of course, Mr Damelin as the . chief executive and the man running the company at the time should be . investigated. If action is not taken then it will undermine confidence . in the regulatory process once again.’ Wonga has been slammed for pressurising indebted to customers by sending letters from fake law firms . Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, Mark Field, said there appear to be grounds for urgent police action. He said: ‘I support this industry, but Wonga isn’t doing itself any favours with this type of sharp practice and it’s a matter of urgency for police attention. Wonga is its own worst enemy on this and this could be the tip of the iceberg.’ Labour MP John Mann has called for the Treasury Select Committee to investigate the payday loan industry and the apparent inability of City watchdogs to fine Wonga for historic offences. ‘The idea that a company can send thousands are letters to customers from imaginary law firms and the regulator not able to fine them is something I and the majority of people in the UK will find appalling,’ he said. Labour MP, Andy McDonald, told MPs in the House of Commons yesterday there was a good case for investigating the directors and removing their right to hold a credit licence. Labour has been keen to play up the fact that a major donor to the Conservative party also holds a huge stake in Wonga, which is said to be worth more than £380million. Adrian Beecroft, who has donated more than £500,000 to the Conservatives since 2006, is also the chairman of Dawn Capital, which has made a fortune from investing in Wonga. Labour MP, Andy Sawford, suggested the only way to make Wonga suffer would be to apply the same interest rates it uses for customers to the £2.6million the company has been told to repay. Using this calculation, he suggested the company would have to hand back £203 trillion. Speaking during the weekly Commons business statement, Mr Sawford said: ‘Can we have emergency legislation on compensation and compound interest to make Wonga pay out not £2.6 million compensation for unfair practice but at their own outrageous interest rates of 5,853per cent, make them pay £203 trillion? ‘Perhaps then they would understand the misery they cause?’ Mr Damelin, 44, has made no comment on the Wonga fiasco since details were released earlier this week. Wonga claimed the businessman, who was educated at Cape Town University, had departed in what it called an ‘orderly exit from the company’ that would allow him to work on new business ventures. The fiercely private individual spilt from his wife Julie, the mother of the couple’s three young children, last year after 15 years of marriage in what was described as an amicable break. Wonga has apologised for the letters and insists that all the managers who were in place at the time they were sent between 2008 and 2010 have since left the business. Asked whether Mr Damelin had suffered any sanction for his part in the fiasco, the company said: ‘The historic debt collection letters are Wonga’s responsibility, and so we won’t be commenting on particular individuals. ‘We provided information on the letters to the OFT in 2011, and since then have been working with them and our current regulator the FCA on a resolution for customers. No-one from the company has been interviewed by the police on this matter.’\n",
      "219. By . Robert Verkaik . and David Rose . Accused: Former policeman Pavel Karpov was linked to the death of Sergei Magnitsky but is now bringing a libel action against the British businessman who named him as a suspect . A former Russian police officer banned from travelling to America after being accused of torture and murder has been allowed to bring an explosive libel claim against a British businessman in London’s High Court. The case, which will cost the UK taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds, is likely to be one of the most expensive ever heard in Britain. It is being brought by Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Karpov, one of the men accused of involvement in the arrest, torture and murder of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky who died in Moscow in 2009. And it follows a high-profile campaign led by Mr Magnitsky’s former boss, William Browder, who wants more than 60 Russian suspects held to account for the lawyer’s death. But Mr Karpov has hired top UK lawyers to sue Mr Browder for defamation in a trial that opens on July 24. The case is cited as one of the worst examples of libel tourism – where foreign nationals with little or no connection to the UK use the High Court to settle their disputes. Last night senior Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘It is absolutely ludicrous a man I hope will never set foot in this country except to face criminal proceedings himself is able to abuse British libel law in this way.’ It comes after a Moscow court last week posthumously convicted Mr Magnitsky of tax fraud and convicted Mr Browder in his absence, sentencing him to nine years in jail. Mr Browder, a British citizen who was born in the US, is chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management – the firm Mr Magnitsky was working for before his death. He has denied the charges and claims the trial is politically motivated. His defence team have said they will appeal against the verdict. Deceased: Lawyer Sergei Magnitsky (pictured in a frame held by his mother Nataliya Magnitskaya) died in prison in 2009 after he accused officials of conducting tax fraud . Mr Magnitsky was arrested in 2008 after accusing officials of a massive tax fraud, but was later himself accused of the crime. In libel papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Karpov insists he had nothing to do with the fraud, subsequent cover-up or the arrest, torture and death of Mr Magnitsky. He says the allegations made by Mr Browder have caused ‘serious hurt, embarrassment and distress’. Libel case: William Browder, a businessman who was Mr Magnitsky's boss, is being sued for defamation after linking Karpov to his death . Mr Karpov’s lawyers insist that while Mr Browder’s quest to pursue those who killed Mr Magnitsky might be legitimate, his campaign has wrongfully made false claims against Mr Karpov. Lawyers for Mr Browder, including Geoffrey Robertson QC, have stood by the claims and say they will show in court Mr Karpov is a prominent figure in a Russian organised crime ring, the Klyuev Group, that specialises in complex financial frauds. The papers also question how Mr Karpov is funding the case, which already includes more than £100,000 paid into court to provide security of costs. His legal team is being led by top QC Andrew Caldecott instructed by high-profile media lawyer Geraldine Proudler. The papers say: ‘Until recently .  .  . [Karpov] was living with his grandmother and mother-in-law in a modest apartment of 54 square metres. In spite of the relatively modest level of salary paid to claimant under the terms of his employment by the Ministry of the Interior, he has acquired very substantial assets and enjoyed an upmarket lifestyle which it would be impossible for him to have earned legitimately through his official position.’ Mr Browder’s team detail how Mr Karpov is a frequent flyer – allegedly spending 225 days travelling outside Russia on 47 trips to 17 different countries from 2004 to 2012. They also reveal how he often travelled on flights with others who have been accused by Mr Browder of belonging to the Klyuev Group. A spokesman for law firm Olswang confirmed Mr Karpov’s libel claim is proceeding, adding he was ‘not banned from travelling to the UK’.\n",
      "220. Duffy has Asperger sydnrome and lived with his beautician Mum Leah in the country town of Kingaroy . Leah says her son is better hacker than state's best cyber crime detective but he's no criminal . A 21-year-old home-schooled computer expert from the Queensland town of Kingaroy - north-west of Brisbane - has been charged with possessing $110,000 of Bitcoins he allegedly obtained during a cyber attack police say he made on the giant US gaming site Riot Games. Police allege Shane Stephen Duffy hacked into the game, League of Legends, which has more than 67 million players across the world, on a laptop at his mum's place in Kingaroy - otherwise known as the peanut capital of Australia. The charges against Duffy come after a combined investigation by a specialist police cyber crime and identity unit in tandem with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In August 2013, Riot Games was forced to reset League of Legends player passwords in North America, causing widespread online fury. The company announced that 120,000 transaction records and credit card data had been stolen. Shane Duffy (above, left) of the tiny Queensland town of Kingaroy is facing fraud and hacking charges related to League of Legends (right), which was created by US gaming giant, Riot Games, and has more than 67 million players worldwide . Digital currency: Police allege Shane Duffy acquired the currency Bitcoins while hacking into Riot Games' League of Legends selling information to players. He allegedly earned up to $1000 a week . Online fury: Tens of thousands of players of League of Legends allegedly had to change their passwords and online security information after the game was disrupted by a hacking scheme . He is facing fraud and hacking charges related to League of Legends, which was created by US gaming giant, Riot Games. Detectives from Queensland's Hi-tech Crime and Investigation Unit have now raided properties in the  towns of Kingaroy, Poona and Hervey Bay investigating the alleged computer offences. Following the seizure of laptops and a hard drive in Kingaroy last November, Queensland police  spent several months forensically examining items and found others located within an 'encrypted container'. Shane Duffy is due to face Maryborough Magistrates Court on July 22 on two counts of fraud by dishonestly obtaining property from another, one count of fraud by dishonestly causing detriment, one count of possessing equipment for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of an offence, and three counts of using restricted computers. Laptop legend: Police will allege in the Maryborough Magistrates Court that 21-year-old Shane Duffy used a laptop while living at his Mum's place to commit computer hacking and fraud on the League of Legends game (above) which has more than 67 million players world wide . Outback hacker: Queensland cyber crime police says the case of alleged hacking of the giant gaming site League of Legends which investigators will tell a court next month originated in small town of Kingaroy, 210km north-west of Brisbane, showed that hackers did not have to own numerous computers and sophisticated equipment, but could just be a kid with a laptop living with his Mum . Peanut capital: alleged computer hacker Shane Duffy lived in the town of Kingaroy also known as the peanut capital of Australia for the country's largest peanut processing plant and silos (pictured) Bitcoin is a payment system which records financial transactions on a public ledger. No actual tangible currency exists, however users of the system can send and receive bitcoins electronically in exchange for products, and services. Although the legitimacy of bitcoins has been questioned and banking authorities warn it lacks consumer protections, it has grown in popularity as a form of payment. One incentive to accept the digital currency is that its fees are lower than those of credit card companies. He will also face Hervey Bay Magistrates Court on July 24 on charges of tainted property relating to the bitcoins and breach of bail offences. Duffy, who has a Californian girlfriend he met online, is a computer genius but totally innocent according to his mother, Kingaroy beauty therapist Leah Duffy. Ms Duffy has defended her son saying the Queensland Police had 'the wrong man'. She said her son, who had been home-schooled since fourth year due to his suffering from Asperger syndrome, which caused him difficulty in normal social interactions, but allowed him to be highly skilled in introverted activities, such as in mathematics, Tech Times reported. Since Duffy has been out of school, he stayed home most of the time and taught himself all about computers.Ms Duffy said her son indeed was a computer whiz and had more computer knowledge than Queensland's best cyber detective, but that he did not commit those cyber crimes. She said any information Duffy had was readily available on the internet for free, and that it was someone else who had made the hacked database public. Police alleged Duffy hacked the servers of Riot Games and was able to acquire player details and details on IP addresses, and sold them all online, which allowed players of Legend of Leagues to slow down their opponents' playing abilities which made them more vulnerable to being 'killed' or eliminated from the game. Screenshots of the data were allegedly uploaded from Riot Games' Twitter account, allowing a profit of up to $1000 a week selling IP addresses. Detective Superintendent Brian Hay of the Hi-tech Crime Investigation Unit said in April the case showed alleged hacking threats could originate anywhere, and were not necessarily a skilled hacker working with multiple computers an sophisticated equipment. Earlier this year Duffy was denied access to computers as part of his bail conditions. An application by Duffy in April to change his bail conditions because he needed computer access to speak to his girlfriend and complete a TAFE course was refused because of the seriousness of the nine charges.

      "221. By . Daily Mail Reporter . Kyle Denton, 27, tried to claim that he had injured his finger falling down a pothole but had actually injured it after he punched someone . A thug broke his finger punching a man then tried to win compensation from his local council telling them he injured it falling down a pothole. Kyle Denton's story fell apart when it emerged he had posted a picture of his finger on Facebook and boasted that he damaged it 'cracking someone'. Officials from Wakefield Council, West Yorkshire, traced the victim of the assault who confirmed he had been hit by Denton. The 27-year-old even met with staff to show them the spot where he had allegedly fallen. Wakefield Magistrates Court heard how Denton’s account became suspicious following the meeting about the authenticity of the claim. Angus MacDonald, prosecuting, said: 'Rather than injuring it in a fall, he had sustained it assaulting a man. 'The defendant stated on the [conversation] thread that it had happened \"cracking someone\".' Denton, of Lupset, West Yorkshire, who had submitted a personal injury claim in November 2012, dropped the allegation and his solicitor stated he would no longer be taking action against the council. Mr MacDonald added: 'No payment was made. The claim was at such an early stage. It’s only through the vigilance of the council and their employees that the suspicious nature of this came to light.' Magistrate Julian Garthwaite told Denton, who admitted fraud: 'You falsely claimed and stuck with that line you had fallen down a pothole to get money from the council. 'You now at the 11th hour have pleaded guilty and said that was incorrect and a bundle of lies.' Denton was sentenced to 100 hours of unpaid community work. He must pay £250 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Cllr Graham Stokes, Cabinet Member for Corporate Performance for Wakefield Council, said: 'We are pleased with the outcome of this case as fraudulent claims can cost the Council valuable time and money in already very challenging financial times. 'False claims will not be tolerated and our insurers and claim handlers are well trained to ensure that public money is not wasted in this way.' Denton posted the picture of his damaged finger, which can be seen with pins in it, on his Facebook page .

      "222. By . Sam Webb . Assisted suicide: Rogue trader Nick Leeson, whose risky investments destroyed Barings Bank, has admitted he contemplated paying two men with Mafia connections to kill him in prison . The man who became a symbol of the excess, macho culture and greed of stock market trading has admitted he considered paying a hitman to murder him in prison. 'Rogue Trader' Nick Leeson, in an interview with CNN, spoke of the dark period of his life in a German cell. Leeson's risk-taking deals led to an £827million loss and single-handedly destroyed the centuries-old Barings Bank. A Watford schoolboy-turned-City whizzkid, Mr Leeson's early career was a success and he was promoted within the bank, but things began to unravel when he started making losses while trading in Singapore and used a secret account to hide them. In 1995 he was finally arrested in Germany, aged just 28, after going on the run when his financial mismanagement was discovered and was imprisoned while awaiting extradition to Singapore. He was surrounded by arms dealers, sex offenders, drug dealers and, he discovered, Italian men with 'connections' - an ice cream vendor, Luigi, and a 'well-dressed man' called Salvatore. He said: 'It would have cost me £10,000 I think. 'I presumed it would happen in the showers one day, someone would just knife me.' Shockingly, Leeson, now 46 and living in Galway in Ireland, had to speak to his wife and father in order for them to negotiate his murder on his behalf. He added: 'Obviously they cried but you have to deal with the reality of situation.' Back in Singapore, he was sentenced to . six and a half years in Changi Prison. He was released in 1999, having . been diagnosed with colon cancer, which he survived despite being given a . slim chance of pulling through. His wife divorced him while he was . inside. Scroll down for video . Darkness: The stark admission came during Leeson's TV interview . During the interview, Leeson also . spoke honestly about his crime and refused to sidestep the blame for the . momentous losses which finished Barings after 233 years of trading. He . added that he has no sympathy for rogue traders Jerome Kerviel of . Societe Generale and Kweku Adoboli of UBS, who lost £6.1billion and . £1.1billion respectively. 'Anything that they've done and . hidden is fraud.' Leeson said. 'I think it's a macho culture that's . evolved. When things go wrong, there's a certain age group that is . usually involved: young men.' Contrite: Leeson readily accepts the blame for his actions, although many have criticised the lack of oversight at Barings Bank at the time . When asked if a rogue trader will ever bring down a bank again, Leeson replied: 'No doubt about it. If you ask anyone in the banking industry, they will say \"yes\", but it won't be me.' Leeson is also considering a return to the financial sector, although, instead of trading, he wants to set up an organisation to help people financially crippled by the banking crisis. He is also a regular guest on the after-dinner and keynote speaking circuit. Downfall: Leeson addresses a press conference. A film was made about him called Rogue Trader and starred Ewan McGregor . From 1992, Leeson at first made large profits for Barings in Singapore. However, his luck turned and he used one of Barings' error accounts (accounts used to correct mistakes made in trading) to hide his losses. Leeson was chief trader while also being responsible for settling his trades, making it much simpler for him to hide his losses. By the end of 1992, the account's losses exceeded £2 million, which hit £208 million by the end of 1994. A series of risky trades in 1995 pushed the losses up further. Leeson left a note reading 'I'm sorry' and fled Singapore on 23 February. The bank was declared insolvent soon after. The Singapore authorities' report on the collapse was scathingly critical of Barings management .\n",
      "223. By . Luke Garratt . and Chris Greenwood . and Arthur Martin . Hundreds of police officers swooped on addresses across London and the Home Counties yesterday in an operation aimed at smashing one of Britain’s most notorious crime gangs. Senior members of the Adams syndicate were among 15 people arrested as officers dressed in riot gear descended on 25 properties. Almost £300,000 in cash, designer watches, a handgun, shotguns and other weapons were recovered after years of painstaking investigation. Police, dressed in full assault gear, prepare raid an address in north London, one of the 22 houses raided that are thought to be hubs for the notorious London criminal gang . Raided: 22 homes serving as bases for an 'established and high profile' criminal gang in north London . Several business addresses were also . raided, including solicitors, accountants and property consultants . suspected of laundering money. At . one safety deposit box in Central London police officers discovered . £25,000 and a stash of expensive watches. In another property, a hidden . safe held £100,000. Scotland . Yard is desperate to land a decisive blow on the Adams syndicate, which . has influence worldwide and has a reputation for extreme violence. It . has been connected to at least 25 murders. Police . suspect members of drug trafficking, extortion and hijacking but in . recent years they have moved into white-collar and high-tech crime, . including mortgage fraud. A specialist police team, codenamed Operation Octopod, has been carrying out surveillance. A man is arrested and led of of one of the raided addresses . Detectives believe they have amassed evidence of conspiracy to assault, money laundering, fraud and revenue offences. The raids were carried out under Proceeds of Crime Act legislation, which investigators hope could help finally smash the gang. One of the properties raided was the £2.5million Clerkenwell mansion owned by Tommy Adams, 55, and his wife Androulla, 54. Tommy, . who once led the syndicate with his brothers Terry and Patrick, was . jailed for seven and half years in 1998 after admitting his role in an . £8million cannabis smuggling plot. Neighbours . knew him as a ‘businessman with a mysterious past’. One said: ‘Tommy is . a man that no one would ever ask him anything about what he did.’ Terry, . 59, who was not arrested yesterday, has already served a seven-year . sentence for money laundering. He was sent back to prison shortly after . his release for failing to declare an expensive ‘post-prison makeover’ arranged by his wife at a luxury Hertfordshire hotel. There . is evidence that members of the Adams family have escaped prosecution . by infiltrating the police and Crown Prosecution Service. Most of the . 200 officers involved in yesterday’s operation were not told the . identities of the targets over fears that the information could be . leaked. At one garden flat in Highgate, North London, police seized a 24-year-old man believed to be a key figure in the group. Officers broke through his front door – protected by an iron grille – using a steel battering ram just before 6am. Det . Chief Supt Tom Manson, of the Met, said the operation aimed to . ‘dismantle’ the gang. ‘This gang has believed they were untouchable but . we are determined to prove they are not,’ he said. ‘The . links between this gang and serious and violent crime are well . documented, as is their strong influence across London, and, we believe, . connections to criminals across Britain and Europe.’ The . family crime business, known to many as the ‘A Team’, was also . suspected of links to the Russian mafia and the powerful Columbian . cocaine cartels. Solicitors, accountants and investment advisers with links to the notorious gang were ordered to hand over documents under the proceeds of crime act, so they could be examined by financial investigators. One of the suspected gang members is taken in by police, led out of the house in north London. The raids were the result of months of planning and building evidence against the suspected criminal gang . A man is led out of a north London home in Clerkenwell by police. In addition to arrests, police confiscated £300,000 of cash and luxury items, and a series of guns . Some of the solicitors and financial . advisors were also taken in for questioning on suspicion that they . helped to run the finances of the gang as mortgage brokers and property . developers. The massive . hit against the gang was launched after detectives apparently uncovered . evidence of crimes including conspiracy to assault, money laundering, . fraud and revenue offences. The . money confiscated totalled around £275,000 in cash, collected in safes . and safety deposit boxes, in addition to luxury items like Rolexes, and . computers and phones, which were used for financial correspondence. Scotland Yard said at one property they found a safe £100,000 'tucked inside'. The . operation was part of a Scotland Yard case against the gang, which has . taken months of detectives following money trails to link the properties . with the gang's criminal gains. While Scotland Yard did not name the criminal ring, which is also known as the . A Team, they did call it 'one of the UK's longest established and high . profile organised crime gangs'. Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Manson of the MPS Specialist, Organised and Economic Crime Command, said: 'We believe we have arrested members of the most long established and high profile crime gang in London. Tommy Adams, (pictured in an older handout for a previous conviction) patriarch and financier of the Adams gang - Described in court as a 'notorious gangster', is also believed to have been arrested as a part of targeted raids on a criminal gang . 'This was a painstaking investigation and a discreet operation run by specialist officers until today when the combined resources of the Met were deployed on the arrest phase of the operation. 'The links between this gang and serious and violent crime are well documented as is their strong influence across London, and, we believe, connections to criminals across Britain and Europe. 'We believe they are responsible for a multi-million pound criminal business; laundering the profits from crime and using this money to commit other money-spinning offences. 'This is cash which can be used to fund further crime and provide luxurious lifestyles. 'For too long organised gangs have used advances in technology that have allowed them to hide their criminal gains and some even believe they can escape justice by bribing those who enforce the law. 'This operation and others like it are the Met's response. 'Any criminal gang operating in London needs to know that we will tackle them head on and hit them where it hurts most, by seizing their cash and assets.' The list of people arrested during the raids, where they were arrested, and their charges is as follows: . All are being held at a central London police station while searches continue. Since 2012, the Metropolitan Police Service has restrained, forfeited and confiscated over £62million in criminal cash and assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002.

      "224. By . Rob Cooper . Murder charge: David Jeffs, 36, battered Roberto Troyan to death in his Mayfair home when his fraud was about to be uncovered, a court heard . A millionaire socialite was murdered by his financial advisor who had defrauded him of £343,000 to fund his fabulous lifestyle, a court heard today. David Jeffs, 36, drove sports cars, dined at fine restaurants and stayed at top hotels using Roberto Troyan's money, it is claimed. In one night the cocaine user blew a staggering £19,500 in strip club Spearmint Rhinos as he ‘celebrated’ his imminent marriage, the jury was told. Jeffs also used the stolen money to buy two Lotus sports cars and to pay for holidays in Mauritius, Ibiza and the USA, Croydon Crown Court heard. But as his dishonesty was about to be uncovered, he battered his 63-year-old victim to death with a suitcase inside his home in a Mayfair mansion block in central London, it is claimed. The body was found by a cleaner in the kitchen of the flat in a pool of blood. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC told the jury: 'This defendant took advantage of a frail and vulnerable man for his own gains over a long period. 'As a result he was able to live the high life but all at the expense of the deceased who, when the defendant first met him, was a rich man. 'He died less rich by hundreds of thousands of pounds thanks to this defendant's dishonesty. 'When the life to which the defendant happily had become accustomed appeared to him to about to be suddenly coming to an end and that there was a real possibility that his callous acts would soon be found out, he killed him. 'Whether the murder of Mr Troyan was planned by this defendant or was committed following an argument when the deceased finally confronted him with his crime, we may never know. 'Only one person is now able to tell us and he has not done so.' Jeffs was a 'devious and clever man' who had been able to carry out his deception by making Mr Troyan rely on him, it is alleged. Mr Brown added: 'The defendant knew well the advantage he had and he used that advantage. 'But the defendant had come to rely on the deceased - or rather his wealth - for his own lifestyle. 'There were expensive sports cars, expensive restaurants, hotels, holidays and clubs, and drugs too, all that had to be paid for. 'This is what was about to come to an end and he was likely to be exposed for what he really was - the consequences were dire.' Mr Brown QC added that the biggest purchases included two Lotus sports cars. 'The reality is that the defendant spent Mr Troyan’s investments on a much more luxurious life than his legitimate earnings would ever have allowed,' he said. Scene: Roberto Troyan was found dead in his property in this mansion block in Mayfair by a cleaner earlier this year . 'He bought two expensive Lotus sports . cars. One cost nearly £20,000 - it was bought in April 2010 - when the . ink was hardly dry on Mr Troyan’s first cheque that found its way into . this defendant’s account...the second one was bought a year later in . March 2011 - by which time he had taken £140,000 from Mr Troyan - cost . £52,000. 'That second Lotus was made up of £37,000 that he paid with his credit card and £15,000 from part exchanging the first Lotus. 'There were sports occasions - . hospitality tickets obviously, it was £1,400 for two - at the rugby and . polo - £1,100 for two tickets. 'He would visit expensive hotels, . expensive restaurants. He would take expensive holidays to Mauritius, . Ibiza, USA each costing thousands of pounds. 'There were nightclubs, for example . £1,150 in one night at a club called China White, and he frequented . Spearmint Rhinos, where there was £19,500 spent in one night in March . 2011. 'This perhaps was some kind of . celebration prior to his marriage to his wife in June 2012. Again people . are allowed to celebrate how they like of course as long as it isn’t . with someone else’s money to which they are not entitled.' Battered to death: Roberto Troyan was found dead in a pool of blood by a cleaner in his Mayfair home . After the killing, Jeffs attempted to . cover his tracks by purchasing replica clothes to replace his . bloodstained ones, it is alleged. Scientists later found blood from Mr Troyan on a briefcase Jeffs was carrying when he went to the flat that afternoon. Jeffs had been employed as his . financial advisor in 2005 following the death of Mr Troyan's partner . Anthony Feldman, an interior designer whose clients included Princess . Michael of Kent and former Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken. Jeffs was to assist in the investment and management of the huge inheritance Mr Troyan received, the court was told. Mr . Brown said: 'It appears Mr Troyan's lifestyle, since his partner's . death, had been somewhat extravagant, in some ways had become chaotic, . and included consumption of alcohol and drugs at his home address often . with others. 'Mr Troyan's habits including his dependency on others, were such as to make him an easy target for financial exploitation. The relationship between the two men deteriorated in the months before the murder as Mr Troyan told friends how much money Jeffs had lost him. Mr Brown said: 'In the days and months before his death, Mr Troyan expressed to those close to him and others his disappointment at losses in his investments, for which he seemed to blame the defendant, his resentment at the financial arrangements in place to curb his spending and his distrust of the defendant in his management of his finances. 'Victim': Mr Troyan who had employed David Jeffs as his financial advisor since 2005 . 'Whatever Mr Troyan's spending and lifestyle habits, his distrust of the defendant in that regard had a sound basis.' Tax records showed Jeffs earned just under £50,000 in 2006-07, £36,460 in 2007-08 and just £6,000 in 2008-09. Mr . Brown added: 'The reality is that with the lifestyle that he had, his . legitimate earnings fell far short of what was required to keep that . high life going.' Jeffs . became a 'financial concierge' to Mr Troyan and paid utility bills, . money owed to a storage company and helped him find a flat and pay the . deposit and rent. Mr Brown . continued: 'Some concerns were raised at the bank when Mr Troyan . explained that he had been providing signed blank cheques to his . financial advisor, however this, so far as the late Mr Troyan . understood, was for investment purposes. 'There are very strict rules as to what access an independent financial advisor can have to a client's finances. 'Such . a situation, whether one designed from the outset or to allow for the . theft of the money or one that the defendant took advantage of, allowed . for stealing the money of a trusting and in some ways inadequate man.' Jeffs later told police he was paid £1,000 a week for his services in this capacity but no record of this agreement has been found. 'Between February 15, 2010 and January 31, 2012 a total of £343,000 has been paid in to bank accounts in the defendant's name by way of cheques successfully drawn on Mr Troyan's NatWest account,' Mr Brown continued. Exclusive neighbourhood: Police launched a murder investigation in Mayfair after Mr Troyan was discovered dead. He had been bludgeoned to death . 'During the same period there had also been attempts by way of the defendant to secure payments totaling £80,000 to Jeffs' accounts by way of cheques initially drawn but which bounced. 'Mr Troyan did understand that these significant amounts would be re-invested for him by the defendant and were not therefore intended to go into the defendant's pocket. 'It was a deception and it worked. Not a penny of the £343,000 was re-invested on Mr Troyan's behalf and it was spent by the defendant on himself and his friends.' Mr Troyan was found dead on March 8. Jeffs, formerly of Arnold, Nottingham, denies murder and fraud by abuse of position. The trial continues.

      "225. By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . Cheat: Dean Ahmed, 49, claimed he needed income support and disability living allowance while earning substantial amounts of money from his properties . A benefits cheat who built up a £1million property empire while claiming to be too ill to work has been jailed. Dean Ahmed, 49, had a secret luxury property empire while posing as a single, disabled man who deserved state handouts. While receiving the benefits - income support and disability living allowance - he banked more than £100,000 while also collecting rent from at least ten houses across Europe. A court heard Ahmed had three houses in Spain and seven in Wales which he rented out. He was jailed for two years and eight months after the court heard he was also paid disability living allowance for being too ill to get a job. All the while the illicit property entrepreneur had lived in a plush apartment in Cardiff Bay - and bought another six in the same waterfront area. Cardiff Crown Court heard he used a false identity to obtain mortgages  and had built up a hidden property portfolio worth close to £1million. Recorder Paul Hopkins told him: 'You were professional, well-organised and ruthlessly dishonest.' Ahmed was jailed after admitting 15 charges: four counts of money laundering, three of mortgage fraud and eight of benefit and council tax fraud. Forensic investigation of his finances found he was 'actively profiting as a property landlord, and had pocketed substantial rental income from his portfolio.' He he had three luxurious apartments in Murcia, Spain, and regularly transferred large amounts of money to banks in the country. The financial investigation also uncovered the sale and purchase of properties, many within the Cardiff Bay area, sourced by false mortgage applications. Seven homes: A financial investigation found that Ahmed had seven properties in Cardiff Bay, Wales . Place(s) in the sun: Ahmed also had three luxurious properties in Murcia, Spain . Chief Inspector Gary Phillips said Ahmed now faced losing his properties after 'amassing a considerable amount of wealth by illegal means.' He said: 'Our focus now shifts to taking away the wealth and assets he has amassed under Proceeds of Crime legislation. 'The case should also serve as a warning to others who may be involved or tempted to commit these kinds of offences. 'Working together we will find you, and as well as putting you before the courts we will also look to regain every penny which has been obtained by illegal means.' Russell Harvey, of the DWP Fraud Service, said: 'A small number of criminals view our welfare system as free money there for the taking and we are determined to catch them. 'These benefit thieves cost hardworking taxpayers over £1billion a year and steal funds that should help the most vulnerable.'\n",
      "226. By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Consumer groups and an MP are demanding a police inquiry into Wonga after evidence emerged it sent bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten customers who were behind on repayments. Britain’s biggest payday lender was yesterday named and shamed by a City watchdog, which ordered it to pay more than £2.6million in compensation to 45,000 customers who received the bogus letters. But consumer groups say there is clear evidence of a criminal deception and insist the police should be brought in. Wonga has been slammed for pressurising indebted to customers  by sending letters from fake law firms . Wonga could be investigated for a string of criminal offences, from fraud to falsely impersonating a solicitor and even blackmail, says lawyer Dan Bunting. It is a crime under the Fraud Act to dishonestly make a false representation, intending to make a gain or cause a loss to another, when you know it is false and misleading. The Solicitors Act of 1974 makes it an offence for someone to falsely claim to be a solicitor –  although there is usually a six month time limit from the date of this particular offence. Wonga could also be charged with blackmail under section 21 of the Theft Act 1968 – as a threat to take people to court could be regarded as ‘an unwarranted demand with menaces’. Mr Bunting said: ‘So, whilst “blackmail” conjures up connotations of masked men making a ransom demand after a kidnapping, this may well be close.’ Shadow consumer affairs minister Stella . Creasy called for a police investigation of Wonga saying: ‘Aside from . potential fraud, harassment of a debtor is a criminal offence.’ The MP pointed out that it is also an offence to pretend to be a lawyer under the 1974 Solicitors Act. She . added: ‘News that Wonga was sending fake solicitor letters to . cash-strapped customers who couldn’t afford their fees to frighten them – . and charging them for these – is further proof of the need for Britain . to rid itself of these legal loan sharks.’ While the company . presents itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with . its friendly TV ad puppets, an investigation by the Financial Conduct . Authority found extensive evidence of ‘thuggish’ behaviour. Among . Wonga’s victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed . repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage. The . FCA said Wonga sent letters to customers in arrears from what appeared . to be two law firms, called ‘Chainey, D’Amato & Shannon’ and ‘Barker . and Lowe Legal Recoveries’ – but these two companies were invented by . Wonga to put pressure on customers. In some cases extra charges were added to the outstanding debt to cover the cost of sending these threatening letters. Despite . the damning evidence, the watchdog added that £2.6million is the . biggest compensation order it can impose on Wonga – because the . wrongdoing occurred before tougher laws were implemented last year. Consumer . Action Group founder Marc Gander said: ‘It seems to me that this was a . criminal deception. Wonga was inventing lawyers and making demands for . charges. I am amazed that there is no substantial fine or criminal . investigation. ‘I don’t think the FCA needs to look very far to find . evidence of laws that have been broken, the real problem is that they do . not seem to have the will or the courage.’ Clive Adamson, director . of supervision at the FCA, said: ‘Wonga’s misconduct was very serious . because it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation . for customers in arrears. ‘The FCA expects firms to pay particular . attention to fair treatment of those who have difficulty in meeting . their loan repayments.’ The £2.6million of redress covers a flat . compensation payout of £50 for each of the 45,000 customers who were . targeted between 2008 and 2010. Some will also get refunds of charges . that were unfairly applied. Payday loan adverts are mostly aired on day-time TV, raising fears that the unemployed are being targeted . Payday firms boomed during the recession, as desperate families turned to high-interest loans to get by . However, this represents a tiny figure in . the context of the company’s profits, which are estimated at more than . £100million a year on the back of making more than four million loans a . year to more than one million customers. One of the company’s two . founders, Errol Damelin, who was chief executive at the time the . threatening letters were being sent, stepped down from his post as . chairman just two weeks ago in what appears to have been a damage . limitation exercise. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com . joined in the attack: ‘This just shows that while Wonga hires expensive . marketing, PR and public affairs consultants to try to position itself . as the good guys in a bad industry, it’s all a sham. ‘Using lawyers . as fake as its puppets, then having the stomach to charge people for it . is a thuggish tactic, aimed at scaring and intimidating people already . struggling.’ The firm’s interim chief executive, Tim Weller, said: . ‘We would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone affected by the . historical debt collection activity and for any distress caused as a . result. 'The practice was unacceptable and we voluntarily ceased it . nearly four years ago.’ An order to pay £2.6million in compensation is little more than pocket money to Wonga and its multi-millionaire founders. Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz set up what is now Britain’s biggest payday loan company in 2007 and within two years had raised £14million from City investors. Today, the two enjoy luxury homes and lifestyles with Mr Damelin’s personal fortune estimated at more than £34million, while Mr Hurwitz is said to be over £25million. Their wealth has been built on the back of families who have struggled for cash during a six-year cost-of-living squeeze, during which time the firm has also attracted many critics. Split: Errol Damelin and his ex-wife Julie, pictured left, and software designer Jonty Hurwitz, right . Mr Damelin, 44, originally from South Africa, started his first company in Israel and became an investment banker on arrival in the UK. He was already a wealthy man when his family set up home in a six-bedroom house in Hampstead, North London, in 2002. The house was bought for some £580,000 and is worth at least four times that figure today. As the business grew, Mr Damelin reportedly paid himself more than £1million a year while cosying up to City investors who have ploughed a total of £100million into the loans colossus. While Wonga has been happy to send threatening letters to customers, the businessman has claimed the loans it provides are force for good. He said in 2012: ‘Credit in consumer society is absolutely critical. Without it, you have no social mobility...wealthy people will stay wealthy.’ Despite his financial successes, Mr Damelin has suffered failure in his personal life and it emerged last year that he was splitting from his wife Julie, the mother of their three children, after 15 years of marriage. Like his partner, Jonty Hurwitz, 44, also originates from South Africa. His background was in technology and he is credited with developing the software that assesses customers on the Wonga site, but now he has stepped back from managing Wonga and likes to see himself as an artist and web entrepreneur. He married Chloe Lander, a 41-year-old violinist, in 2001 and five years later bought a £950,000 home on the border of  Surrey and West Sussex in order to pursue a leisurely life as a sculptor. Writing about Wonga, he boasted of having been the ‘thinker, the designer, the visionary’ in the ‘glorious moment’ when the company began trading. His art, he says, is a way to ‘allow my ego to feel fantastic’.\n",
      "227. A former portfolio manager in Florida was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison on Monday after helping his firm earn more than a quarter-billion dollars through an illegal insider trading scheme. Mathew Martoma, an ex-trader from Boca Raton, earned his firm SAC Capital Advisors more than $275million through an insider trading scheme where he cultivated a relationship with two doctors that later provided tips. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe said the sheer amount of the record-setting fraud merited the long sentence. Scroll down for video . Going inside: Mathew Martoma, 40, a former portfolio manager for SAC Capital Advisors, was sentenced on Monday to 9 years for a record-breaking insider trading scheme . Martoma, 40, left federal court in Manhattan hand in hand with his wife. Gardephe ordered him to begin serving the sentence in November for his February conviction on charges of conspiracy and two counts of securities fraud. Martoma had flattered and enriched two doctors with inside information about the secret results of an Alzheimer's drug trial so they would tip him off and he could trade ahead of public announcements. The tips enabled SAC Capital Advisors, based in Stamford, Connecticut, to earn more than $275million illegally. The success caused the firm, headed by billionaire Steven A. Cohen, to reward him with more than $9million in bonuses. The judge ordered Martoma to forfeit $9.3million, including his home and banks accounts holding millions of dollars in the names of him and his wife. Family man: Martoma left the courthouse holding hands with his wife Rosemary. He has three children ages 9, 7 and 5 . Long trip: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Martoma 'traded his liberty, his name and his time with his family for what in the end is nothing.' Martoma declined to comment before the sentence. As the judge announced the sentence, saying \"the sums here are staggering in size,\" Martoma stood and looked straight ahead, and his wife wiped her eyes with a tissue. The judge said the illegal edge Martoma obtained as he traded in the stocks was a crime that is \"deeply corrosive to our markets\" and caused people to be cynical about the financial industry. \"The gain here is hundreds of millions of dollars more than has ever been seen in an insider trading prosecution,\" the judge said. He rejected requests by Martoma's defense attorney, Richard Strassberg, that he receive a sentence of two to three years in prison because of his charitable work. He also rejected claims based on the need to take care of his wife and three children, ages 9, 7 and 5. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement that the \"long and short of Mathew Martoma's trading is that he traded his liberty, his name and his time with his family for what in the end is nothing.\" Strassberg had insisted Martoma made a sensible decision to sell the bloated stocks of the pharmaceutical companies that sponsored the drug trial. At the trial, Sidney Gilman, a former professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School, testified he gave Martoma secret results of the drug trial sponsored by Elan Corporation and Wyeth nearly two weeks before they were publicly announced in the summer of 2008. Gilman, once one of the world's top Alzheimer's experts, said he was charmed by Martoma. He said he seemed more knowledgeable about his work than hundreds of other financial professionals who paid Gilman more than $1million over several years for consultations. SAC Capital pleaded guilty in November to fraud charges and agreed to pay $1.8billion to settle charges that it allowed, if not encouraged, insider trading for more than a decade. Cohen has disputed the allegations involving his company.\n",
      "228. Jailed: Paul Burnett, 45, ran a sophisticated benefits swindle over 17 years using dead friends' names . A benefits cheat has been jailed for stealing two dead friends' identities in a 17-year 'campaign of deception' which netted him £232,000. Paul Burnett, 45, set up alter egos as 'tenants' in a string of houses he had bought - then claimed incapacity, housing and council tax benefit, jobseekers' allowance and income support in their names. His sophisticated swindle, which included posing as one friend who died in a 1988 motorcycle crash and another who drowned in 1996, was only discovered when one of his living victims returned from Australia. By the time he was caught, Burnett was having to keep 16 diaries to organise his life as a 'full-time fraudster', Bradford Crown Court heard. When Department of Work and Pensions investigators finally caught up with him, he confessed: 'It was easy money. 'It started off because I was skint but then it turned into a game.' The court heard Burnett claimed benefits using his own name and those of four other men between 1996 and 2013. The first, Michael Gilmartin, was a friend who had died in a motorcycle crash in Leeds in 1988. Posing under the fake name, Burnett bought a house in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and took on a tenant by the name of Ian Wright. But 'Ian Wright' was actually Burnett under a second fake name - and he claimed £61,174 in incapacity benefit, housing benefit of £35,629 and council tax benefit of £6,487 from Calderdale Council. To claim the incapacity benefit, which has since been phased out by the government, Burnett had to obtain an NHS card for 'Ian Wright' and complain he was unfit to work due to depression. The court heard how 'Ian Wright' - whose real-life double had in fact left Britain to live in Australia - was prescribed Prozac, declared unfit to work and even referred to a counsellor. Burnett's third identity was Michael Wells, a friend who had drowned in Greece in 1996. He bought a house in Bradford, West Yorkshire, under Mr Wells' name and then pretended he was a tenant to claim a string of benefits. Burnett's claims had a deep effect on his dead friend's sister - who was offered a 'glimmer of hope' that he had not drowned after all, the court heard. Burnett's fourth identity was Stephen Hackett, who was still alive but had moved to France following a family fight. Scam: Burnett operated his fraud by buying several houses under false names in West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire and Rochdale, Greater Manchester, then claiming benefits. Pictured: One of his homes in Bradford . As Stephen Hackett, Burnett again managed to obtain an NHS Medical Card and even a birth certificate. 'Stephen Hackett' then claimed £11,845 housing benefit, £2,501 council tax benefit, £9,271 jobseekers' allowance, £24,190 incapacity benefit and £16,476 of its successor, the employment and support allowance. He had a bank account with Cheltenham and Gloucester and - as with 'Ian Wright' - was signed off as unfit to work after telling doctors he had depression and suicidal thoughts. Burnett was only discovered after the real Ian Wright returned home from Australia and found letters demanding money and claiming he had been receiving benefits. He contacted the authorities and police traced Burnett to the home where 'Stephen Hackett' was living in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire. Justice: Burnett was jailed for three years today at Bradford Crown Court. Judge Jonathan Rose told him: 'Benefits are to help those in need, not those who are seduced by greed. You are a greedy man Paul Burnett' Records showed Burnett - using his real name - had bought the house in cash for £70,000 and 'Stephen Hackett' was supposedly living there as a tenant. But they found the 16 diaries which exposed the scale of the scam, linking him with the other properties in Halifax and Bradford. They also showed he had links to Keighley and Todmorden in West Yorkshire and Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Burnett pleaded guilty to 20 separate counts of fraud and making false representations. Judge Jonathan Rose told Burnett he had seen the benefits system as 'a portal to riches'. 'Benefits and the benefits system are to help those in need, those unable to finance their lives without the support and assistance of the state,' he said. 'They are not there, in your own counsel's words, for those who are seduced by greed. You are a greedy man Paul Burnett. 'Your case has a deeply unpleasant and deeply hurtful aspect of you stealing the identities of men who have lost their lives.' Stephen Wood, defending, said Burnett has an 18 year old daughter and told police he 'was seduced by greed'. 'He was encouraged by the ease with which these offences could be committed,' Mr Wood said. 'They didn't require special tools or special knowledge'. Speaking after Burnett was sentenced, Bob Gallacher, from the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error Service said cases such as Burnett's cost taxpayers' money. 'The majority of people claiming benefits are honest, but there are some who abuse our welfare system and we will catch them,' he said. 'Cases like this cost hardworking taxpayers money that should be used to help those in need. 'DWP financial investigators are pursing Burnett to recover the money that he has fraudulently claimed, and this will go back into the public purse.' 'If you suspect someone of benefit fraud, please call the Benefit Fraud Hotline on 0800 854 440 so we can continue to tackle the problem in our area.'\n",
      "229. When a man wants to spend the rest of his life with a woman, he often extends an offer to her to become part of his family. But International Polo Club Palm Beach founder John Goodman, 48, did so in a very unorthodox way. The multimillionaire trust-fund heir adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Laruso Hutchins last fall, after being accused of drunk driving in a 2010 accident that left 23-year-old Scott Wilson dead. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Newest family member: John Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall . Goodman is being sued by Wilson’s parents for wrongful death. According to police reports, Goodman ran a stop sign on February 10, 2010 in Wellington, Florida and smashed into Wilson, sending his car into a canal. Scott Wilson, a 23-year-old graduate of the University of Central Florida, was killed in 2010 . Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post. Court papers show that Goodman adopted Ms Hutchins in October of last year, CBS12.com reported. ‘My reaction was that it was both awful and brilliant,’ Belray Beach adoption attorney Charlotte Danciu told CBS12.com. The adoption papers state that Hutchins, now a legal child of Goodman, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust. Goodman and Ms Hutchins began dating in 2009, according to her testimony. The Wilsons’ attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman is attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets. ‘It cannot go unrecognised that (Goodman) chose to adopt his 42-year-old adult girlfriend as opposed to a needy child,' he told the paper. Judge Kelley wrote that the events are taking the court ‘into a legal twilight zone.’ The trial: John Goodman's lawyer said in court that the adoption has nothing to do with his pending criminal trial . Wreckage: Goodman is charged with driving while intoxicated and vehicular manslaughter after police reports show he ran a stop sign and slammed into Scott Wilson's Hyundai, right . Ms Danciu agreed. ‘Unless you intend to create the parent-child relationship, you are violating the letter of the law,’ she told CBS12.com. Arrested: John Goodman is currently on trial for the DUI death of Wilson . Scott Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer. He had been driving his Hyundai home . to Wellington to visit his family, according to the Palm Beach New Times . when he was struck by Goodman's Bentley convertible after he ran a stop sign. Wilson's car was knocked into a nearby canal, where he drowned. Goodman was found to have a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit after the fatal 2010 crash, police reports show. He will be criminally tried March 6, facing charges of DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and leaving the scene of a crash. He could spend up to 30 years in prison if found guilty, the Palm Beach Post reports. The civil trial will be some weeks later on March 27. Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told myfoxorlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more. ‘It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said. Goodman’s father was the late Harold Goodman, who built a fortune from a heating and air conditioning manufacturing business. His family sold the business in 2004 for a reported $1.4 billion. He converted his father’s horse farm into a polo ranch and later began building his empire. His club became a magnate for the rich and famous, entertaining the likes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Sylvester Stallone, and Charlton Heston. Even Madonna was spotted at the club, attending an International Polo Club match in 2009. Goodman’s wealth is a point of a heated dispute. The Palm Beach New Times questioned the heir’s true assets, quoting Mr Wilson’s lawyer. Attorney Chris Searcy said Goodman is much richer than his financial documents show. He is seeking punitive damages that will ‘sting (Goodman) badly without bankrupting him,’ Mr Searcy told the New Times. Celebrity hot spot: John Goodman and Hilary Duff, left, pose with an elephant At International Polo Club annual Polo Ball black-tie gala in 2007 . According to the website, Mr Searcy thinks Goodman’s wealth is buried in numerous trusts and companies, and is as ‘sophisticated’ a method as he’s ever seen. The financial battle has been closely tied to the wrongful death suit. In 2002, the mogul sold his Wellington estate to his children’s trust fund for $3.8million, according to the New Times. But he only rents it for $2,000 per month. According to an August 2011 report by the Palm Beach Post, his two children have more than $200 million in their trust funds. Mr Searcy suspects he has full control over those trusts. Mr Searcy also said in court that Goodman has an airplane, yacht, polo ponies, and an unspecified amount of his father’s $1.4billion fortune from Goodman Manufacturing. Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club attracts A-list celebrities . Home sweet home: Goodman sold his Wellington mansion to his children's trust for $3.8million and now pays $2,000/month rent . In a 2006 document, Goodman claimed one of his trusts was worth more than $100 million. Mr Searcy pointed out that Goodman claimed in 2011 that trust was only worth $6.9 million. The Wilsons have already settled privately with the Player’s Club, a bar in Wellington where Goodman had been drinking in February 2010. They claimed that the club was partially responsible for the crash because they served Goodman even though he was intoxicated. Lifestyles of the rich and famous: Goodman owns the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida . The bartenders deposed that Goodman wasn’t noticeably drunk. Goodman divorced his first wife Isla Carroll in 2008 after 22 years of marriage. In the April 2009 divorce filing, Ms Carroll said she was fearful for the safety of herself as well as her children. Jeanne T. Tate, a fellow of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, has been practicing adoption law for nearly 30 years. She told MailOnline that while nothing illegal was done when John Goodman adopted his girlfriend, she’s seen many cases where adoption ‘is used for purposes other than what you’d traditionally think it was intended.’ In Florida, adult adoptions do not have the same requirements as traditional child adoptions. She explained: ‘A lot of the traditional adoption statutes- including home studies – those protections are eliminated when you’re adopting an adult, with less government intrusion being the goal.’ She said the only people who have to consent in an adult adoption are the adoptee and the adopter. Under Florida law, they do have to give notice of the adoption, though Ms Tate notes that parental consent is not required. ‘The court may not have been aware of many things,’ she said, ‘including that there was a pending wrongful death suit, or that she was a girlfriend.’ When asked if is now legal for Goodman to have sex with his daughter, Ms Tate responded: ‘That’s a good question. I’m not a criminal lawyer, but it’s a solid question to wonder about.’ She said that because they’re both adults and not biologically related, the question’s answer is murky. ‘Creepy,’ she said,’ but I don’t know if that’s illegal.’ Attorney Wayne Richter told MailOnline that under Florida law, the statutory has no law against having sex with an adopted child as long as there is no lineal consanguinity - meaning there is no close blood tie, such as aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew. Ms Tate said that should Goodman wish to marry Ms Hutchins after the criminal case, it would be a difficult endeavour. The statute, she said, is permanent in the eyes of the law. ‘Even for fraud of duress, you have to bring the challenges in front of the court.’ In Florida, all adoption papers are sealed and cannot be viewed by reporters or third parties. ‘A court could order the file open,’ Ms Tate said,’ but it is difficult to do’ – in most cases because of the sensitive nature of protecting identities. Ms Hutchins could in theory, with the consent of Goodman, be re-adopted by her parents and then marry him, Ms Tate said.During Goodman’s civil case, Ms Tate said the court could open the adoption file and examine if there was any fraud on the court or the adoptee (Ms Hutchins). She added: ‘There’s nothing illegal, per se, about adopting your girlfriend.’ Watch the video here: .\n",
      "230. Shahab Reza, who is deaf, has admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions out of thousands of pounds by falsely claiming benefits for sign language interpreters . A deaf man and his family falsely claimed £800,000 for sign language interpreters in a 'dishonest and greedy' benefits scam, a court has heard. Shahab Reza, of Perivale, west London,  submitted fake invoices to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) but used the money to fund holidays, jewellery and university fees, prosecutors say. The 51-year-old and his wife, Shehnaz Reza, both of whom are deaf, also involved their children, Zainab Reza, 22, and Abbas Reza, 26, it is claimed. Father Shahab, 51, has admitted his role in the swindle and is facing years behind bars. Mother Shehnaz and children Zainab and Abbas all deny being part of a conspiracy. Southwark Crown Court heard Shahab masterminded a four-year scam by submitting fake invoices for sign language interpreters to the DWP through the Access to Work scheme. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said: 'This case concerns dishonesty and greed that started with Shabab Reza, who has acknowledged his dishonesty by pleading guilty to every count that he faced on the indictment. 'He was assisted by his wife, Shehnaz Reza and his children, Abbas and Zainab Reza, to obtain taxpayers' money through sophisticated frauds at the heart of the benefits system. 'Shahab Reza is deaf and so is his wife. They... pretended that they required the assistance of British Sign Language interpreters and Support Workers dishonestly, to obtain grants from the Access to Work Scheme, operated by the Department for Work and Pensions. 'Approximately £800,000 was paid into bank accounts controlled by members of the Reza family. It was spent on property and jewellery, holidays and investments.' She added: 'Many thousands of pounds were obtained through this simple, but clever fraud. 'Housing benefit was paying for the family home and the children's day-to-day expenses were met by grants and bursaries. There was money to spend. 'In order to be able to spend the money it needed to appear to come from legitimate business income. 'The Reza family set about laundering the money through accounts in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the UK.' The family spent the money on property in Dubai, a new luxury family home and £600,000 penthouse apartment, the court heard. Shehnaz Reza (pictured, left) and her children, Zainab (centre) and Abbas (right), deny conspiracy to defraud . Prosecutors said that when the alleged fraudsters were arrested there was thousands of pounds worth of gold jewellery and gems in a safe at their house, as well as a £8,000 diamond. The court heard Shahab also lied about his family's financial circumstances to Harrow Council, netting nearly £100,000 in benefits and tax exemptions between June 2002 and August 2010. The Reza family is also accused of conning the NHS and the Student Loans Company, with Abbas allegedly receiving a fraudulent bursary. Ms Cottage told the court: 'Shahab and Shehnaz Reza also told lies to the claim Housing and Council Tax benefit to pay for the family home. 'The overpayment of this benefit amounted to some £100,000. Shahab Reza and his children also carried out frauds to top up their student income when Abbas and Zainab were at university and when Abbas was studying medicine. 'These frauds were perpetrated against the Student Loans Company and the NHS Bursary Scheme, both of which exists to assist those with few means. 'The ease with which these frauds were perpetrated is scandalous; the extend of the Reza family's greed and ability to lie is breathtakingly arrogant.' Mother Shehnaz, 53, and her children Abbas and Zainab, each deny conspiracy to defraud. They accept that a scam took place but claim they were 'doing what they were told' and did not realise that the documents they signed were important, the court heard. Southwark Crown Court heard claims the scam was a 'simple but clever' way of swindling thousands . Shehnaz Reza further denies single counts of fraud by false representation, obtaining money transfer by deception and dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability. Zainab denies a further count of fraud by false representation, while Abbas denies two counts of fraud by false representation. Shahab Reza admitted conspiracy to defraud, two counts of obtaining money transfer by deception, two counts of dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability, and three counts of fraud by false representation. Four deaf friends of the family - Saifur Rahman, 31, Ahsan Naseer, 29, Natela Babina, 30, and Daiva Alisauskaite, 42 - are also on trial, accused of being part of a swindle. Naseer, of Birmingham, Babina, of Wembley, north west London, Alisauskaite, of Hackney, east London, and Rahman, of Camden, north London, all deny conspiracy to defraud the Department of Work and Pensions. The trial at Southwark Crown Court in London, which is expected to last two months, continues. Shahab allegedly started the scam after realising it was easy  to get reimbursed for sign language interpreters . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
      "231. Benjamin Harris Todd III never gave up hope of finding his kidnapped daughter. Now his ex-wife faces deportation this month from Australia to a US prison, he nervously hopes Savanna Todd can love him as a father. The intensely private stockbroker from America's Deep South understands why the daughter snatched from him in 1994 by her mother Dorothy Lee Barnett and who never knew him as father has so far held off from speaking with him. Charleston stockbroker, Benjamin Harris Todd III, (pictured with baby Savanna in 1994) never gave up hope of finding his kidnapped daughter who became the subject of an FBI international manhunt . The only father she knew: Savanna Todd (left) thought her name was Samantha Geldenhuys and that Juan Geldenhuys was her natural father. She is pictured here with Geldenhuys, her half brother, Rhys, and mother, whose real name is Dorothy Barnett . 'His daughter thus far has been reluctant to meet,' Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis, told the MailOnline. 'She only knows her mother and the misinformation that has been provided her. She likely would be considered by her mother to be disloyal if she were to meet [Todd] at this time.' As Barnett faces an extradition hearing in a Queensland court and possible immediate immigration detention as early as next week ahead of deportation to the US, Benjamin Todd fears jeopardising his hoped for reunion with his daughter. But Mr Sturgis said Todd yearned for the 'long awaited opportunity' of meeting Savanna. He had literally counted the days - 19 years, six months and 12 days - from the access visit on which Savanna disappeared with her mother, to when Australian police knocked on a door in a beachside suburb and arrested Barnett for abduction. The Yale-educated, softly spoken Southern gentleman has refused to speak with the media about the daughter he spent endless hours and a considerable amount of his fortune on a worldwide search for her. The extraordinary story of how Barnett eluded the FBI for two decades, and how her life as a lie unravelled, is said to have 'deeply confused' 20-year-old Savanna Todd. Until the day federal US charges of child abduction and passport fraud were laid against her mother last November, the young nursing student believed her name was Samantha Geldenhuys and the recently deceased Juan Geldenhuys - really her stepfather - was her biological parent. Dorothy Barnett's friends have launched a campaign against Benjamin Todd, telling the Seven Network's Today Tonight he had wanted Barnett to terminate her pregnancy with Savanna in 1993. Savanna Todd (left), who only learnt her real name three months ago is said to be 'deeply confused' about the fact her mother kidnapped her and is 'reluctant' to meet Benjamin Todd, the father (right) she never knew . Friends of Dorothy Barnette (left, with daughter Savanna) have llaunched a campaign against Savanna's real father, Benjamin Todd, calling him 'evil' One friend described Todd as an 'evil, evil man' while Barnett herself described his pursuit of her as 'corrupt' and 'criminal'. Details have emerged about the doomed relationship between the quite classical music lover, Todd, the son of a nurse and a doctor from Kentucky, and Barnett, who was raised by a single mother and stepfather on welfare. Todd spent his career working at financial management company Merrill Lynch in Charleston, South Carolina. Barnett ran a piggery in Belize, a jewellery business in Africa, finally settling for a job as a flight attendant before meeting Todd and marrying him in a whirlwind romance. When the marriage failed, and Todd gained custody of Savanna after a court case which alleged Barnett was bipolar, she was awarded only supervised access to her daughter. It was on one of these visits Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and had a son. The couple emigrated to New Zealand, where they gained citizenship, and then Barnett and her children moved to Australia's Sunshine Coast, where they were known as Alexandria, Samantha and Rhys Geldenhuys. It was over evening drinks after a day's sailing in 2011 that Barnett slipped up. She referred to Samantha as 'Savanna' and said she had fled an 'abusive' relationship in America. Barnett's South African friends went online and found a page on the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's website. Savanna Todd (pictured as a toddler) has only known Juan Geldenhuys (right) as her father, causing 'deep confusion' about her real identity . They saw pictures of a woman who looked like a younger 'Alex' and an age-advanced photo of a girl who resembled Samantha. They contacted Benjamin Todd in America. His long hunt for Savanna was over. J Graham Sturgis said Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her there on her birthdays,' Sturgis said. 'It is a parent's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [but] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery.' It is believed Dorothy Barnett does not hold Australian citizenship and risks detention should she be granted bail from Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre. A hearing in Maroochydore Magistrate's Court will determine whether she is 'eligible for surrender' to the US, after which the Federal Attorney General will decide whether to give Barnett over to US authorities. If Barnett loses an appeal against extradition, she will be deported to the US and imprisoned in a federal correctional facility until she faces court over the alleged kidnapping and passport charges, for which she could serve more than 20 years if convicted.\n",
      "232. A US-led operation has disrupted an international crime ring that infected hundreds of thousands of PCs across the globe with malicious software that stole more than $100 million from businesses and members of the public since 2011. The Justice Department announced on Monday that anywhere between 500,000 and 1 million machines worldwide were affected by the virus's known as Gameover Zeus which stole banking passwords and Crytolocker, which encrypted files and blackmailed the users for their release. Among the victims of the cyber-attacks were Pittsburgh based Reinforced Plastics of Erie, which lost $373,000 in one money transfer and the Swansea, Massachusetts police department, which paid a $750 ransom after their computers were infected. Scroll down for video . Threat: U.S Deputy Attorney General James Cole announces two global cyber fraud disruptions of the Gameover Zeus and Cyrptolocker programs at the Department of Justice in Washington on June 2, 2014 . Other victims included a Florida bank that lost nearly $7 million through an unauthorized wire transfer. Authorities in nearly a dozen countries worked with private security companies to wrest control of the network of infected machines. 'These schemes were highly sophisticated and immensely lucrative, and the cyber criminals did not make them easy to reach or disrupt,' said Leslie Caldwell, who heads the Justice Department's criminal division, to a news conference. But while the grip of those behind the 'malware' has been weakened by the counter attack, computer experts said users must take this opportunity to install anti-virus software and update their operating systems to the latest versions to stop it regaining its hold. 'The criminals effectively held for ransom every private email, business plan, child's science project, or family photograph - every single important and personal file stored on the victim's computer,' Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said at a news conference. Those who fail to do so risk having their valuable data, including precious photographs, music and personal files held to ransom. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained by the criminal network. The Gameover Zeus software, has spread worldwide but has been temporarily disabled by the international effort by law enforcement agencies. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers rebuild the network. Hackers will be able to install new ones, but it is thought that there will be a window of opportunity of at least two weeks for computer users to protect themselves. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. The software installs itself on a computer when the victim clicks on a link in an unsolicited email or via a website. It then sends out more emails to lure further victims, without the knowledge of the computer users, and spreads quickly across the internet. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained . Could Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic? He is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic. But the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and ‘slavik’. The 30-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as ‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online banking accounts. The FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009.Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname ‘lucky12345’ by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on a number of charges including Bank Fraud, Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Aggravated Identity Theft. On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy, Computer Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud and Money Laundering. Then just days ago on May 30, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘lucky12345’ to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud. He is described as white with brown hair (though his head is usually shaved) and brown eyes. He is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds (82kg). Bogachev was last known to live in Anapa, Russia. He is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. The virus lays dormant until it spots an opportunity to steal personal details such as online banking information and passwords. It then transmits this information back to the criminal network who use it to drain the victim’s accounts. In a further twist, if the user is not a ‘viable’ victim then the software locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom. Last night, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers accusing a Russian named Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev as being the leader of the gang behind the software. U.S. officials said Bogachev was last known to be living in the Black Sea resort town of Anapa. A civil suit in Pennsylvania helped authorities get court orders to seize parts of the infected network, and on May 7, Ukrainian authorities seized and copied Gameover Zeus command servers in Kiev and Donetsk, officials said. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers - whose attempts have been temporarily thwarted - can rebuild their network. The US Department of Homeland Security urged users to install anti-virus software on their computer and ensure that the latest operating systems were also installed on their computers. If systems do not offer automatic updates, people should enable it, the department said. It also advised changing passwords, as original passwords may have been compromised during the infection. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security set up a website to help victims remove the malware, www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus. From that website, computer users can download tailored anti-virus software which has been provided for free. Experts have also warned users to back-up all valuable data. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. He faces criminal charges in Pittsburgh, where he was named in a 14-count indictment, and in Nebraska, where a criminal complaint was filed. He has not been arrested, but Deputy Attorney General James Cole said U.S. authorities were in contact with Russia to try to bring him into custody. Russia does not extradite accused criminals to other countries, so Bogachev may never be arrested. 'The criminals effectively held for ransom every private email, business plan, child's science project, or family photograph - every single important and personal file stored on the victim's computer,' Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said at a news conference. The FBI called the alleged ringleader, 30-year-old Evgeniy Bogachev, one of the most prolific cyber criminals in the world and issued a 'Wanted' poster, pictuted, that lists his online monikers and describes him as a boating enthusiast . Officials say the case is another stark reminder of the evolving cybercrime threat, though it's unrelated to the recently unsealed cyber-espionage indictment of five Chinese military hackers accused of stealing trade secrets from American firms. Both sets of hackers relied on similar tactics - including sending emails to unsuspecting victims that installed malware - but the Chinese defendants were government officials who sought information that could bring companies in their country a competitive advantage. Bogachev's operation, prosecutors say, consisted of criminals in Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom who were assigned different roles within the conspiracy. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security set up a website to help victims remove the malware, www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus.\n",
      "233. Spared jail: Lekeshia Henry-Richards, 28, stole signatures of around 150 clients of the exclusive private banking service based in the City of London . A NatWest banking officer who sold wealthy customers' details to criminals running a £400,000 fraud was spared jail because she has two young children. Lekeshia Henry-Richards, 28, stole signatures of around 150 clients of the exclusive private banking service based in the City of London. The information was used by a gang of swindlers to go on spending sprees at Apple and Selfridges stores in Beirut, Marseilles and London. One customer lost more than £130,000 before the scam was stopped in April this year. The mother from Leytonstone, east London, was spared time in prison because of her two young children, aged eight years and 18 months. She was sentenced at London’s Old Bailey to two years in jail suspended for two years - and ordered to carry out 90 hours of unpaid work. Judge Gerald Gordon said: ‘You were convicted by the jury of conspiring with other people to commit fraud upon your employer NatWest bank, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland, by abusing your position as relationship advisor dealing with high value accounts at the branch in the City. ‘Between March and November 2011 you obtained details, mainly customer signatures, which you supplied to others for them to use in persuading the bank that customer change of address notifications were genuine when they were in fact fraudulent. ‘Credit cards, PIN and cheque books were sent and as a result of those details fraudsters could make use of the accounts and the resulting fraud netted the conspirators something in excess of £400,000.’ He added: ‘The reality seems to be that you got yourself into this for some reason, perhaps after some attempt to avoid it, and those you were supplying the information to had a strong hold over you. Your prolonged criminal conduct cost your employer a very large sum of money. Bank: The judge said she conspired 'with other people to commit fraud upon your employer NatWest... by abusing your position as relationship advisor dealing with high value accounts at the branch in the City' ‘The offences were fraudulent from the outset, lasted a substantial period of time and involved a substantial number of financial victims, although the bank assumed the losses. ‘You were acting while in an important position of trust within the bank. It’s difficult to see that you have shown real understanding of the seriousness of what you have done.’ Judge Gordon said the offences were serious enough for Henry-Richards to be sent to prison but that he had to consider her son and daughter. ‘They both have their own real problems and each is at risk if you are sentenced to immediate custody,’ he said. ‘Their position is a factor that it is right to take into consideration today. ‘With considerable hesitation I have come to the view that the sentence I pass is two years imprisonment suspended for two years.’ Henry-Richards used customer account numbers, addresses and images of their signatures to order new credit cards. The replacement cards were then diverted to the criminal gang. Signatures were obtained from the . accounts records in breach of her position as an employee, put on the . letter and sent to the bank. The . bank updated their records, taking the letters on trust with what they . thought were genuine signatures. Some time later replacement credit . cards and PINs were sent out. Big money: In one case the fraudsters went on a spending spree of more than £130,000 in Beirut (left), Marseilles (right) and London . From there the cards were in the hands of fraudsters who in one case went on a spending spree of more than £130,000 in Beirut, Marseilles and London. When the bank investigated the suspicious spending on that card they discovered around 150 other accounts had also been compromised. On all of those accounts Henry-Richards had accessed information and on most she had accessed the signature image panel. 'You were acting while in an important position of trust within the bank. It’s difficult to see that you have shown real understanding of the seriousness of what you have done' Lekeshia Henry-Richards . Text messages recovered by police from Henry-Richards’s mobile phone showed that she had been stealing the details to order. When interviewed by police she claimed she had been threatened by a man called ‘Steve’ who she thought was a member of a gang. Alexia Power, defending, said Henry-Richards has an eight-year-old son and baby daughter aged 18 months. ‘She is a single parent with two young children,’ she said. ‘She has suffered from mental health problems for a number of years and made numerous suicide attempts over the years. ‘She is the sole carer of two dependent children. To separate her from her very young children could lead to serious harm.’ Henry-Richards was convicted after trial of conspiracy to commit fraud between March 2011 and April 2014. She was also made the subject of a two-year supervision order and 12-month women’s programme.\n",
      "234. David Cameron will this week come under mounting pressure to make sure families forced to miss their holidays because of the Government's passport crisis get their money back. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said ministers urgently needed to look into compensation schemes for those who couldn't go abroad as a result of lengthy delays in processing their passports and vowed to press the Government on the issue in Parliament tomorrow. He said he would be tabling parliamentary questions about what the Coalition is doing to discuss the situation with insurance companies for those with travel policies. David Cameron, pictured here at the Trooping the Colour ceremony in London yesterday, will this week come under mounting pressure to ensure families that have missed their summer holidays get their money back . Passport applications awaiting to be processed at an office in Liverpool due to a massive backlog . He told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News: 'I want to explore this week - and I will be tabling parliamentary questions tomorrow - what the Government are doing to discuss with insurance companies for people who have taken out travel insurance. But it is a real issue.' The Financial Ombudsman, which deals with disputes between the public and finance firms, has said it may ask an insurer to pay the claim for a cancelled holiday as long as the policyholder had 'done all they reasonably could to chase the passport application' and had 'put in their passport application in far in advance of the deadlines laid down by the passport office'. In a statement last week it said: 'If they (the holidaymaker) were still unable to travel due to the delays, then we would be looking for the insurer to act in the spirit of the insurance policy.' The development came after the Home Secretary Theresa May announced a raft of measures on Thursday designed to clear the application backlog. She said passport applications would be fast-tracked for free for those who need to travel abroad urgently. In an emergency Commons statement, Mrs May insisted the Government was doing all it could to deal with the backlog of more than 30,000 applications which had not been dealt with within the normal three-week deadline. But there are growing fears that Mrs May's decision to draft in emergency staff to clear the backlog could leave the passport service open to risk. It emerged today that 1,000 passports could be issued to ‘suspect’ overseas applicants because staff are not carrying out standard checks due to the huge backlog at the Passport Office. These documents could be issued within the next fortnight, sources within Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO) claim, despite Home Secretary Theresa May’s vow that security would not be compromised. The security loophole has been exposed after staff in the HMPO’s ‘Special Security Division’ were diverted to help clear up the chaos elsewhere. Shadow immigration minister has called on the Government to make sure that families who missed their holidays through no fault of their own are properly reimbursed . These highly trained officials are usually responsible for carrying out multiple fraud checks on documents sent in with overseas applications. The problem is being compounded by the drafting in of inexperienced staff who are unable to spot suspicious answers on applications and alert the Special Security Division. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘All hands are being called to the pumps and the Security Division is now like one man and a dog for the rest of the month with the majority of staff transferred to other duties. ‘The Security Division estimates that within the next couple of weeks, because of this panic, there will be at least 1,000 “unsecure” passports issued to “suspect” persons.’ Last week, Theresa May confirmed that responsibility for dealing with applications for passports overseas had switched three months ago from British consulates abroad to an online system based in the UK monitored by HMPO. She said the change was made to provide better value for money and to ensure more ‘consistency’ of service. She stressed that security would not be compromised. But the HMPO source added: ‘At one of the major Passport Office hubs, in Glasgow, they’ve now been lumped with passport applications from every registry throughout the world, which have to be checked, double-checked and triple-checked. The Security Division handles the potentially fraudulent applications and subjects them to rigid scrutiny. ‘There is a template system in place to sift suspicious applications which Passport Office staff have been trained to recognise. ‘But the Government is drafting in inexperienced Border Agency staff to help. The problem is that they will not recognise certain key answers that would alert full-time staff.’ The Security Division was set up after it was discovered ‘bulk’ applications mainly by Eastern European gangsters were being made for British passports and a small number had been processed. Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed that security will not be comprised while the passport application backlog is tackled . As the Glasgow team picked up on the problem, it was decided to base the unit there. Last week, leaked documents from the HMPO revealed a plan to ‘relax’ checks on applications from overseas. The Home Office said it had been ‘unaware’ of the proposed change and ordered the guidelines to be withdrawn. An HMPO spokesman said: ‘Security is our priority and we will not issue a passport until all  necessary checks have been satisfactorily completed.’ Meanwhile, civil servants at HMPO received bonuses worth more than £1.8 million last year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The bonuses were paid out to thousands of employees for ‘good performance’ at the service, which now has a backlog of 500,000 applications. More than 94 per cent received the ‘in-year’ bonus, supposed to be handed out to staff who have exceeded ‘key business targets’. Sarah Rapson, the former chief executive, received a bonus worth between £5,000 and £10,000 in 2012/13. On Tuesday the current chief executive, Paul Pugh, will go before the Home Affairs Select Committee to face questioning over the crisis. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is unbelievable that bonuses have been paid to those who have presided over a service that is now a byword for incompetence.’\n",
      "235. Conmen bombarded lonely women on a dating website with gushing messages of love to con them out of £220,000, a court heard yesterday. The group created false profiles on Match.com to pose as middle-aged men and told victims they were their ‘soulmate’ and ‘inspiration’. One woman received a message describing ‘the love thundering into our hearts that only we can understand’. Scroll down for video . On trial: Adewunmi Nusi and Brooke Boston (covered) leave the court, where they are accused of taking advantage of vulnerable women looking for love in return for cash . Scam: The gang are accused of using a fake profiles set up on match.com - mainly with the name James Richards - and then gradually swindled cash from vulnerable women . The gang invented a story about . needing money to ‘free up’ a £1.5million inheritance locked in an Indian . bank account to press the ‘vulnerable’ singletons for cash, prosecutors . said. Monty Emu, 28, . Eberechi Ekpo, 26, Adewunmi Nusi, 37, and Brooke Boston, 28, allegedly . pocketed £220,000 from women they targeted. One woman paid them £174,000 . in total, the court heard. Opening . the trial at Winchester Crown Court, prosecutor Simon Edwards said . bogus Match.com accounts were  set up to contact ‘emotionally . vulnerable’ users. One profile, for ‘James Richards’, described him as ‘very attractive’ and listed his height, build and hair colour. Once . they lured a woman they would exchange messages on the site and then . move to text messages and email, where they were unmonitored, jurors . heard. Victim: Suzanne Hardman sobbed as she told the court that she was duped by the false profile of James Richards into handing over about £170,000 . Manipulation: This email reveals how the women were bombarded with messages where 'James' declared his love for them but also mentioned problems that would be solved by their cash . The victims were . told Mr Richards’ father had died and left him £1.5million. He asked . them for £700 to help fund a trip to India to access it. ‘Mr . Richards’ went on the trip but hit problems and needed more money to . obtain a series of certificates and an affidavit to release his . inheritance, the story went, with the sums ranging from £10,000 to . £100,000. The scam included . a fictitious lawyer, Rod Thompson of ‘Quality Solicitors’, fake court . documents and tax clearance certificates. Mr . Edwards said: ‘The operation of the conspiracy was fairly . straightforward and its success depended on the trust and co-operation . of the victims in this case. ‘It . is fair to say – and I hope I do not do them a disservice in this – by . and large the victims were financially vulnerable and also to an extent . emotionally vulnerable. ‘The . conspirators exploited their emotional vulnerability to ensure . financial reward for them and those who laundered the money.’ Money was paid into bank accounts and transferred on, and cash was withdrawn around Portsmouth, Hampshire, Mr Edwards said. Contact: The men allegedly sent amorous messages via the dating site before moving to email and text to ask for money . Suzanne . Hardman, of  Basingstoke, Hampshire, handed over £174,000 in several . payments after being contacted by ‘James Richards’ in March 2012. She . received messages saying she made him ‘feel like a complete man’ and . another – referred to in court as the ‘thundering email’ – that told of . ‘the love thundering into our hearts that only we can understand’. Mrs . Hardman broke down as she told the court how, having separated from her . husband, she handed over her savings from the sale of her former . marital home. ‘Certain . things just didn’t seem right, but because I was led to believe that I . was dealing with a solicitor it seemed fine, because he was taking care . of the money – or so I thought,’ she said. But not all women contacted fell for the group’s claims, and the scam eventually came unstuck, the court heard. Mr . Edwards said ‘elementary mistakes’ were made, such as a passport . supposedly belonging to James Richards sent as proof giving his name as .

      "236. The man who allegedly lied to secure a $400,000-a-year position with Myer is now being accused of also using fake CVs to con his way into four other lucrative jobs. American businessman Andrew Flanagan is accused of falsifying his credentials to secure a senior role with Myer in June this year. On Monday, Flanagan fronted Melbourne Magistrates’ Court for a committal mention hearing, facing nine fraud charges. The court was told that Flanagan organised friends to pose as former employers, supplying Myer recruitment firm Quest International with fake references, numbers and email addresses. Mr Flanagan was fired by Myer on his first day when suspicions were raised that the 36-year-old had conned his way into his high-level job. Andrew Flanagan is accused of lying about his employment history to gain employment with five different companies, including a senior role with Myer in June this year . The court was told that Flanagan has lied about his experience to gain employment with four other companies since 2011. It's alleged by the Prosecution that Flanagan was paid more than $170,000 whilst working in the roles, according to Herald Sun. Flanagan is also facing charges of 'obtaining financial advantage by deception and theft' through his dishonest conduct. According to claims in court documents filed during the hearing today, Flanagan secured four other lucrative, high-level positions. Flanagan is accused of acquiring a $350,000-a-year job with Speciality Fashion Group by providing a fake CV, according to the court documents. It's alleged the company paid Flanagan more than $106,000 whilst he worked as their Chief Operating Officer between February and April this year. The businessman was also allegedly hired as CEO for the Australian Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry from November 2013 to February of this year. The 46-year-old is being charged with obtaining more than $32,000 from the company, as well as stealing a laptop. To secure the role with Myer, it is alleged Mr Flanagan claimed to have held several ‘senior executive business positions’ including roles with international retail chain Zara and UK company Tesco . In 2012, Flanagan worked as a casual lecturer at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE by allegedly lying about his previous experience, a court heard. He is being accused of fraudulently obtaining $20,000 from the TAFE. According to court documents, in 2011, he reportedly fabricated his employment history to attain a $180,000-a-year executive role with Bendigo Health. The company paid him $10,000, according to the court documents. Mr Flanagan faces four charges of obtaining property by deception and two charges of making a false document. He is also accused of obtaining a financial advantage by deception and attempting obtain property by deception and theft. Andrew Flanagan’s allegedly dishonest behaviour was exposed when he was appointed Myer’s group general manager of strategic and business development in June this year, a court heard. The Crown told the court that at the time Myer sent a media release about their new employee, citing Flanagan’s impressive background in business. Flanagan claimed to have held several ‘senior executive business positions’ including roles with International retail chain Zara and UK company Tesco. Myer was allegedly informed by corporation Inditex, the Spanish owners of Zara, that Flanagan had never held a position with the company, the court heard. Mr Flanagan's defence lawyer Rowan Slattery told a committal mention hearing on Monday he disputed some of the witness evidence and added there were issues around whether a falsity in a resume constituted the alleged deception. But Magistrate Charles Rozencwajg said: \"If he handed up references and they were false, that's really what the charge is all about.\" Mr Rozencwajg said the issue went \"south\" after Myer announced Flanagan's appointment in the media and the alleged deception became known and Flanagan was not performing as well as someone with his credentials was expected to. Flanagan's bail was extended until December 15 for a one-day committal hearing in the Melbourne Magistrates Court. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
      "237. A postman helped steal £141,000 from Royal Mail customers by swiping letters containing personal bank details, a court heard today. Archie Johnson is accused of targeting post addressed to recipients in London's W1 postcode, encompassing the upmarket West End district, to steal personal financial information. This was then used by accomplices to impersonate account holders and defraud their bank accounts, the court heard. 'Position of trust': Archie Johnson is accused of abusing his role as a postman to steal personal financial information from letters addressed to recipients in London's upmarket W1 post code area . Prosecutor Warwick Tatford said: 'Post men are given positions of trust - they look after the mail and they are entrusted to deliver it to the right address and also not to steal it. 'Sadly the Crown's case is that this defendant did steal mail and he didn't just steal things like DVDs or books or money in birthday cards - nothing like that - what he stole was financial information.' In a scam running between 2008 and 2012, Johnson felt envelopes for bank cards then passed them on to fraudsters higher up the chain, prosecutors alleged. Jurors were told Johnson was 'acting on orders' from other people. Prosecutors said there is 'clear evidence' Johnson stole 'a lot of items'. Bank cards were found in his car, the court heard. 'What he did was target financial documents, in particular bank statements, debit cards and PIN numbers,' said Mr Tatford. 'It is probably pretty obvious to anybody that a hard rectangular shape in an envelope is some kind of bank card. 'Bank statements also are obvious pieces of post and you will know if you have bank accounts that PIN numbers come out in the post as well a few days after cards are sent.' Johnson was 'a cog' in a wider fraud that hijacked bank cards in the W1 postcode of London, prosecutors said. Other members of the gang would allegedly impersonate the card holders to empty the accounts of cash. 'What happened in this case, and the defendant was a vital cog in this conspiracy, is that criminals were pretending to be owners of cards and they answered security questions,' said Mr Tatford. 'They have derived a certain amount of information to be able to answer security questions and they created a situation where the card was sent out to the owner.' Johnson then intercepted the private post and the cards were rinsed of cash before the account owners noticed and alerted their banks, jurors were told. Place of work: A Royal Mail worker steps out of a van at the Rathbone Place depot, where Johnson worked and carried on the scam between 2008 and 2012. File image, there is no suggestion this man was involved . The total losses to Santander from the allegeldy hijacked data was £93,853. Barclays suffered losses of £47,550 from the alleged fraud, the court heard. 'The defendant was a cog in the machine, he didn't, it would appear, profit greatly by this,' said Mr Tatford. 'Perhaps it is the nature of many criminal conspiracies - those in a safe position are ones that keep most of the money. 'A postman may be able to give useful information to his leaders, the people further up the chain, because the postman finds out a lot about people. 'It may well be that the reason those fraudsters were able to answer security questions is that they were able to be fed personal information that the defendant discovered simply by being a postman to this particular address.' Johnson worked at Royal Mail premises in Rathbone Place near Tottenham Court Road in central London. He was arrested after investigators linked his postal rounds with the stolen details, the court heard. Johnson, of Stoke Newington, north London, denies conspiracy to steal. The trial continues.

      "238. Umar Mughal, 27, is currently on trial at the Old Bailey accused of fraud by abuse of position . A NatWest bank manager gave £830,000 to a fraudster posing as a 91-year-old customer 'because he wanted to eat his fish and chips', a court heard. Umar Mughal, 27, approved the bogus transfer of the funds at the Brentwood branch in Essex where he worked. He allegedly failed to carry out any checks to confirm the identity of the man who came into the branch on May 9 2012 claiming to be a wealthy client. Mr Mughal put his error down to the 'negative atmosphere' in the bank, while also claiming that he was trying to have his lunch at the time of the incident. Financial investigator Julia Payne told the Old Bailey that when the bank's system was examined there was no sign that Mr Mughal had confirmed the customer's signature. She continued: 'From a banking perspective people working in the branches know we could be targeted by a fraudster and to look at documentation to see if it is genuine.' Ms Payne added: 'The computer trail tells us what enquiries have been made in the account. 'As soon as Mr Mughal sat down he entered the sort code and account number. 'I would have expected to see a signature enquiry as that's how Mr Mughal told me he identified the customer. 'But the first thing after that is the funds transfer.' She said: 'There is no looking into the account for signatory or anything of the kind.' Prosecutor Fer Chinner said: 'The man comes into the branch and the transfers are made by Mr Mughal. 'Mughal logs on to the computer system at 14.07 and logs off at 14.34.' She said that Mr Mughal accessed five different accounts during the session and transferred the money into one account. Jurors heard £70,000 was taken from the first account, £10,325 from the second, £73,300 from the third, £23,100 from the forth and £76,600 from the final account. Mr Mughal was manager at the Natwest Branch in Brentwood, Essex, (above) when he says he accidentally approved fraudulent transfers worth £830,000 . The suspicious activity was spotted by the customer's private banking manager the following day who raised the alarm, it is said. Ms Payne said: 'The customer had a private banking manager, customers with large balances as he had would have a banking manager. He has blamed his grievous mistake on the 'negative atmosphere' in the bank, claiming his colleagues had been 'moaning all day' 'He noticed the large number of transfers the next day.' She added: 'He first contacted the branch and spoke to Mr Mughal to find out what had happened. 'Mr Mughal explained that the customer had come in.' Mr Mughal was investigated by the bank and claimed during an interview on May 10 2012 that he had 'made a mistake', the court heard. He allegedly tried to blame his colleagues for 'moaning all day' and creating a 'negative atmosphere'. During questioning, he said: 'I've done one stupid little thing which for me was a stupid thing but for the bank was massive. 'I never make the same mistake twice and unfortunately this mistake was big.' He added: 'When it comes to this transaction do I want to put it on here that I gave £800,000 to someone else because I wanted to eat my fish and chips?' Ms Payne asked him: 'Is that why?' Mr Mughal replied that he wanted to take his break and 'ignored' the procedure for customer identification. He added: 'I just wish I could turn back time and do my job again like I normally do.' Mr Mughal, of Walthamstow, east London, denies fraud by abuse of position. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
      "239. A minicab driver who claimed he was earning just £700 a month but was living a luxury of life in his Nigerian mansion, has been ordered to pay almost £1.2million. Ovo Mayomi and his wife Juliet Ubiribo were convicted of fraud in 2010 after using an identity and immigration scam to falsely claim £43,000 in benefits. Mayomi, 44, claimed he was earning £700 a month and was living in Croydon, south London, while his wife, 32, claimed benefits after telling benefit bosses she was a single mother and a victim of domestic violence. Fraud: Ovo Mayomi, 44, left, claimed he was earning . £700 a month and living in Croydon, south London. His wife Juliet . Ubiribo, 32, right, told benefit bosses she was a single mother and a victim of . domestic violence . But fraud investigators found Mayomi . and his wife were actually living in a large luxurious house in Lekki near the Nigerian city Lagos worth more than £1million . complete with chandeliers and £89,000 worth of sound equipment. He also . had a £25,000 watch. His wife wore a Rolex watch and drove a Mercedes . Sport Coupi. Now a judge has ordered Mayomi to pay £1,197,743.54 in a confiscation order under the Proceeds Of Crime Act, or go to prison for six years. As well as two money-transferring . businesses and bank accounts, investigators also discovered Mayomi owned . a fish farm in the country. The couple's benefit scam unravelled when a visa application by Mayomi showed they had married a year . earlier and that Ubiribo had a job in order to support him. Wealth: Fraud investigators found Mayomi owned a . large luxurious house (pictured) in Lekki, near the Nigerian capital Lagos worth more than £1million complete . with chandeliers and £89,000 worth of sound equipment . Modern: The well-equipped, contemporary kitchen inside Mayomi's plush Nigerian home . Opulent: A chandelier hanging inside the mansion in Lekki, Nigeria . Master bedroom: Mayomi claimed he was earning just £700 a month as a cab driver . Luxurious: The bathroom in Mayomi's Nigerian mansion was fitted with a free-standing bathtub . All mod cons: The mansion was found to be equipped with £89,000 worth of sound equipment . Ubiribo also asked the council to rehouse her because she was the victim of domestic violence. However, . the telephone number she gave revealed the man she named as her . landlord - Ayiomike Neburagho - was, in fact, her husband Mayomi using a . false identity. At a police interview, Mayomi . admitted that while living in Nigeria he had bought the identity of . Ayiomike Matthew Neburagho and had entered the UK as him. Mayomi was also shown a wedding photograph of himself, using the Neburagho identity, marrying a Nigerian woman in the UK. He admitted he was the groom in the wedding photo but he said he was 'just standing in for someone'. Ubiribo and Mayomi pleaded guilty to all charges. Mayomi was jailed for 30 months two years ago and his wife was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years. She was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service and be under curfew for four months from 9pm to 6am. Court orders were signed freezing . their assets in the UK and abroad in 2010, and an investigation was . launched to find out how much the Nigerian-born couple had gained from . their criminal lifestyle and what the extent of their assets was. Mayomi, of Ashburton, disputed the . results of the assets investigation, and a subsequent four-day . confiscation hearing took place at Croydon Crown Court. Imposing: This photograph shows a vast hallway inside Mayomi's Nigerian home . Mansion: The house was fitted with pricey sound equipment, chandeliers, and a vast, contemporary kitchen . Scam: Ubiribo stated she was a single parent to claim housing and council tax benefits to help her pay £900 in rent each month. A visa application by her husband . showed Ubiribo had a job . in order to support him . On Friday, Judge Nicholas Ainley . ruled that Mayomi must pay £1,197,743.54 by 14 March next year. It is . one of the largest confiscation orders carried out by a council. Failure . to do so will see him sent to prison for six years, during which time . interest will accumulate on his debt, which will remain due following . his release. At a hearing . in July, a confiscation order was made against Ubiribo for £9,357.42 to . be paid by 19 October or face five months in prison. Investigators had discovered she was the owner of a Rolex watch and a Mercedes Sport Coupi. Councillor Dudley Mead, deputy leader . of the council, said: 'This is a landmark case for Croydon as it is the . first time the council’s in-house financial investigator has pursued a . major confiscation order of this nature. 'Usually . these cases are dealt with by the police rather than local authorities. It is rare for councils to have their own in-house investigator, so it . is to the anti-fraud team’s immense credit that it is pioneering the way . forward in reclaiming the proceeds of crime. 'As . a result of our investigator’s fine work, the council expects to be . able to claw back as much as £400,000 in taxpayers’ money. 'This . case should serve as a clear warning that crime does not pay. Croydon . Council will always prosecute in fraud cases and seek to recover money . or assets wherever they are. 'This is to protect decent taxpayers from having to pay more.'\n",
      "240. Ann Shoebridge, 66, from Nottingham started online dating five years ago. She has since been targeted by con men eight times . Ann Shoebridge started online dating five years ago after her marriage ended. The 66-year-old from Nottingham signed up to a couple of sites after hearing success stories from friends. But after being on the receiving end of no less than eight attempts at fraud, the retired IT lecturer has almost given up any hope of ever finding another man. Con men have targeted her with a number of creative stories, ranging from their children needing immediate medical treatment, to suggestions that she share the cost of the man's travel expenses to fly to the UK for a date. She said: 'I’ve had a couple of guys that had ‘sick children’ and desperately need an operation in the next few hours, otherwise they’ll die. 'The very first wannabe scammer pretended to have a sick child. 'He very quickly wanted to start chatting on MSN. I guess most of them do actually, because it is away from the dating site. 'I wasn't very experienced on these sites, but I knew it was a scam when he asked for money. 'Plus, his profile picture reminded me of the kind of male models you get on knitting patterns! 'I now respond with, “yes of course I’ll help you, you poor man, give me your phone number,” and then I pass it to an online fraud site.' But it isn't just that she has been lied to, one of the most disheartening aspects is that these ruses often come after Ann has wasted at least eight weeks and a degree of hope on conversations with the man in question. The fraudster can often take months to build up a story that they think is convincing, trying to give off an air of personal wealth before approaching the issue of borrowing money. Scroll down for video . Ann said: 'Then there was one man on match.com who was very good looking and lived fairly local to me, 20 miles away. 'We had been speaking for quite a while before I suggested meeting up for coffee and he said, “I can’t, I have to go to Dubai tomorrow on business.” 'We exchanged numbers and he called me from ‘Dubai’ and I remember thinking that he didn't sound like a white man - like he appeared in his pictures. Fraudsters regularly patrol dating websites, hoping to convince vulnerable and lonely women that they are a trustworthy man who is looking for a relationship . 'He gave me a story about being born in South Africa, then moving to Germany and eventually England, where he had been for 25 years, but he didn’t have an English accent.' Then eventually, the man started to broach the issue of money. Ann said: 'In a conversation quite a few weeks down the line, he told me that it was his birthday soon and he was hoping to buy himself a Rolex, it was a comment designed to make you think that he has a bob or two. 'Then he started asking me what kind of jewelry I wore and he asked me to photograph my hands and send the picture to him. 'He’d apparently been back home but was away again on business, this time in Rome. 'So over a period of eight weeks he was really grooming me. 'Then he mentioned that he really needed £500 to pay his hotel bill. 'I don't have that kind of money to spare, but even if I did there is no way I’d give a complete stranger. People on dating websites are warned never to hand over any financial details to potential suitors . 'I said no, you’re a scammer and he got very uppity and angry. 'Then we talked several weeks later and I asked him if he was Nigerian and he admitted that he was.' But far from being put off by the shame of being caught out, the man was back on the same site within weeks. In another incident, an American serviceman claiming to be in Special Ops said he was working in Iraq, which meant he couldn't access his own money. He asked if Ann could wire him £500 as a loan until he was able to return home. She said: 'I was wary from the moment he said he was in Special Ops, because if that is anything like the SAS, he probably wouldn't have been able to tell me. Ann is trying to remain optimistic, despite several bad experiences . 'I insisted on Skype, so that I could see what he looked like and immediately thought that the place he was in didn't look much like Iraq. 'Then he asked me to send him $500 as he couldn’t access his own money. 'I eventually told him I thought he was a scammer and he was very indignant and started shouting. 'I screen grabbed the messages and reported him to the dating site, but they never came back to me and within a matter of days this man had two more identities. 'He used the same photos, but different names and different locations, places like Wolverhampton.' Ann has never handed over any money, always suspecting foul play. But after being duped several times, the mother-of-two was too disappointed to carry on looking for love any longer. She eventually signed back up after realising that it was one of the best chances she has of finding another man to share her life. She said: 'I am retired and although I’m quite busy with various things during the day, I don’t get the opportunity to go out much at night and how else will I meet a man other than online? 'I’m lonely, I’d like a man in my life but I feel like I’m not going to find one. 'If nothing else, being on these sites gives me hope - I’m a glass half full sort of person and I live in hope. 'I guess I probably never will meet somebody, but if I’m on a dating site then I’m in with a chance, it’s a bit like the lottery.'\n",
      "241. Mastermind: Virgin Atlantic pilot Mark Entwistle was jailed for 14 years for orchestrating a £30m scam . A Virgin Atlantic pilot who blew 'prodigious sums' in Las Vegas casinos while masterminding a £30million mortgage fraud has been jailed for 14 years. Innocent families had to leave their homes in and around Windsor, Berkshire, after they were unwittingly caught up in the scam by 47-year-old Mark Entwistle. He and three accomplices tricked top lenders including RBS into issuing mortgages on other people's houses. In one case they managed to take out five mortgages on a single property. But instead of investing in homes, Entwistle  funded a high-rolling lifestyle which included a platinum membership at Vegas casinos Bellagio’s and Caesar’s Palace . Entwistle, an established property developer living in Windsor, also frittered away the cash on a luxury boat and paid off other debts - 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' - as the housing crisis tightened in 2009. He even blew vast sums on the gambling website Betfair, Southwark Crown Court heard. Entwistle recruited Jonathan Gilbert, 45, to act as his solicitor and mortgage brokers Nicholas Pomroy, 58, and Matthew Robinson, 40, to process the sophisticated frauds. The four men were jailed for 34 years between them after a six-month trial as Judge Martin Beddoe branded Entwistle ‘arrogant and greedy, brazen to the last with no expression of remorse'. The judge told him: ‘This trial has been nothing but another gamble for you but the odds have proved to be too long this time. ‘Between 2005 and 2009 a substantial and sophisticated fraud was committed against banks and other lenders, some 14 of them or so. ‘The fraud was for the benefit of you, Mark Entwistle, orchestrated by you and Jonathan Gilbert and assisted in some ways by Mr Robinson and Mr Pomroy. ‘Only a small amount was ever used for the purposes of the loan, and it was often a case of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. Partners in crime: Entwistle, 47 (left) recruited Jonathan Gilbert, 45 (right) to act as his solicitor in the complex four-year fraud, which left innocent families in the Home Counties having to move out of their homes . ‘A great deal of money was blown on your excesses Mr Entwistle, to keep up the vague pretence to your friends and others of what a rich and successful man you were.' He added: 'This was very well orchestrated, professional offending over a long period of time, using and abusing the identities of others. 'This is a story of arrogance and greed. ‘You may be a good pilot and had a great vision for the development of properties in and around Windsor but none of that exceeds your arrogance or greed. ‘You thought you were better than anyone else and you were unable to get over the need to show off your entrapments of wealth. ‘When it was all falling apart you could so easily joke with Mr Gilbert - you were cynical to the last. ‘You were dishonest and had no compunction but to lie and defraud. Ever since the enquiry in mid-2009 by lenders and the enquiry of Thames Valley Police in 2010, you have continued in the same vein and lied’. Spree: Entwistle had a platinum membership at the Las Vegas casino Caesar's Palace, the court heard . The court heard Entwistle and Gilbert fleeced RBS and Northern Rock out of more than £6million, using variations on the name Rigby Group to secure illegal mortgages between 2005 and 2009. At first the money was genuinely used to redevelop property and sell it on at a profit, said prosecutor Michael Shorrock QC. ‘As time went by, however, he began to raise finance by fraud,' said Mr Shorrock. ‘The loan applications would state that loan funds were to be used to refinance or purchase or develop a particular property.' When mortgages were approved, Gilbert did not tell the Land Registry about other mortgages on the property, tricking lenders into thinking they had more legal rights and collateral than they did. One house in Ascot, Berkshire, was remortgaged five times for more than £3million pounds and has since been demolished. In other cases the gang took out mortgages on properties already owned by unconnected people, who had no idea of the loan until the lender told them payments had been missed. One family had to move out of their £1.5million home for three years after building society bosses arrived to repossess it. Caught: Matthew Robinson, 40 (pictured) helped process the fraudulent mortgage applications. He was jailed for five years after he was found guilty following a six-month trial. The judge branded him 'inherently dishonest' The alarm was finally raised in July 2009 when Wilmett Solicitors in Maidenhead, Berkshire, where Gilbert was a partner,  was wound up due to the debts with the loss of 70 jobs. Gilbert was banned from practising as a solicitor in the same year, but his fellow partners faced financial ruin when they were saddled with the liability. During the police investigation, it emerged paperwork held by Gilbert at the solicitors’ firm had been destroyed. But investigators established Entwistle had netted just over £30million over four years, with the loss to today’s money lenders calculated at £17,798,939. He had paid Gilbert by giving him an American Express card which he used to buy holidays to New York, Sardinia and New Zealand. Entwistle also paid the rent on Gilbert’s home in Windsor, Berkshire, allowing him to live there for free. Con: Broker Nicholas Pomroy, 58, who 'deliberately told lies and made up figures', was jailed for three years . The ringleader was sentenced in July, but the fraud can only be reported now after a court order was amended. He was jailed for 14 years after being convicted of 21 counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of conspiracy to launder criminal property. He was acquitted on one count of conspiracy to commit corruption. Entwistle's right-hand man Gilbert, of Penarth, South Glamorgan, pleaded guilty to 18 counts of conspiracy to defraud and was jailed for 12 years. The judge said his crimes were 'as bad a breach of trust as it could get'. 'Inherently dishonest' Robinson, of Richmond, Surrey, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of four counts of conspiracy to defraud and one of conspiracy to launder criminal property. And Pomroy, of Baughurst, Hampshire - who 'deliberately told lies and made up figures that were untrue' - was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and jailed for three years. Two other defendants - Philip Barker, 47, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, and Shon Williams, 48, of  East Grinstead, West Sussex - were cleared of all counts after the trial. Both were acquitted by the jury of involvement in any conspiracy to defraud or commit corruption. Detective Chief Inspector Mick Saunders, of Thames Valley Police, said today: 'Fraud is not a victimless crime. 'Testimony was heard in court about the stress suffered by some whose homes seem to have been sold from underneath them, those who lost life savings and investments and those who lost jobs due to the callous and predatory actions of Entwistle and those who worked with him. 'This organised gang defrauded millions of pounds and I am pleased with the prison terms handed down to them. 'I hope their time behind bars will give them the opportunity to reflect on the pain and misery their actions have caused. 'We continue to investigate their financial affairs to bring Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings against them to ensure they do not benefit from their crime.' Treat: Gilbert was handed an American Express card which he used to travel to New York as payment . One couple first learned of the fraud when bailiffs arrived on their doorstep in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, telling them their £1.5million home would be repossessed. The husband and wife had to take their 12-year-old son out of school and move in with their in-laws for three years when the house became caught up in legal wrangling. The knock on the door came in mid-2007 from a Birmingham Midshires Building Society representative. 'He said he was here about a repossession,' said the wife, who asked to remain anonymous. 'They came because the mortgage had not been paid by Rigsby... He said the owners were Rigsby. I said \"What are you talking about? We are the owners\". 'I didn’t know what was going on. I thought we were going to be evicted from our house.' Once the problem was reported, fraud teams quickly began investigating the case, but that did not prevent the family’s problems mounting. They were unable to sell their home as they had already planned, because it was caught up in the case. Instead they had to rent it out to try to save money. That meant moving nearly 80 miles away to stay with in-laws in Littlehampton, West Sussex. 'It has caused us five years of turmoil,' she added. 'It was a big relief at the end because it was a lot of stress.' Her husband, a semi-retired IT manager, said of Entwistle: 'I don’t think he actually thinks he’s done anything wrong. It really impacted on our lives.'\n",

A man has been charged over allegations he defrauded an elderly woman of her house for his personal financial advantage, after watching an episode of A Current Affair. 43 –year-old Ian Lazar was taken into custody and charged with obtaining the house by deception. Detectives raided his North Sydney home on Thursday and his company office, seizing pieces of evidence. Scroll down for video . A man has been charged over allegations he defrauded an elderly woman of her house for his personal financial advantage, after watching an episode of A Current Affair . The crooked financier allegedly came to the financial rescue of 82-year-old pensioner Amy Hewitt in 2003, when he heard her horrific story on A Current Affair and offered to pay her mortgage for her, as an act of generosity. Ms Hewitt appeared on the popular TV show after she was faced with the prospect of losing her house. The elderly woman was walking to the shops in Bowral, south of Sydney, 11-years-ago, when she slipped on a broken footpath and fell. 43 –year-old Ian Lazar was taken into custody and charged with obtaining the house by deception .

Ms Hewitt passed away a few years later in a nursing home. Mr Lazar has been refused bail and will appear before Sydney's Central Local Court on Friday. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Commander of the Fraud and Cybercrime Squad, Detective Superintendent Arthur Katsogiannis, had some advice for people who have been a victim of fraud. 'Some people feel too embarrassed or scared to report fraud matters to police, but it's vital that we are made aware of what has happened,' he said. 'That way, we can make the necessary inquiries and minimise the chances of other people being targeted and ripped off.'\n",
      "243. Nearly two years after a banker who vanished was wrongly declared dead, he was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in prison as he faced angry investors who lost millions of dollars entrusted to the former preacher who turned his persuasive powers into a career as an investment adviser. Aubrey Lee Price, 48, fled southeast Georgia in summer 2012 after committing acts of fraud that consumed most of the $40 million he raised from 115 clients and left the small Montgomery Bank & Trust, where Price served as a bank director, depleted of its assets and reserves. The bank closed several weeks later. Price was captured alive in a traffic stop near the Georgia coast in December 2013 and months later pleaded guilty to three federal fraud counts, saying he lied to clients and gave them phony financial statements to cover his tracks as he lost their money in speculative trading and other high-risk investments. Contrast: Price, left, before his disappearance and right, after 18 months on the run living like a vagrant on the outskirts of the Florida town of Citra. He has now been jailed for 30 years . Back in court for sentencing Tuesday, Price gave a rambling 40-minute speech that blamed the bank's managers and others for financial losses that he said he tried to fix by making bad investments. Price sidestepped the year-and-a-half he spent as a fugitive and asked those he'd betrayed to trust him to get their money back. 'I understand the pain these people feel. I understand their bitterness and their anger,' Price said. 'In prison or wherever I am, I will find a way to make restitution for my debts.' Mary Jo Peters wasn't buying it. The former Delta Air Lines worker took the witness stand during Price's sentencing, saying she invested all her retirement savings with Price and lost every penny. After Price vanished, she sold her furniture, appliances, clothing and even plants in her yard in a desperate effort to avoid losing her home. Peters said she now works two jobs to pay her bills. 'I'm glad he's not out there able to do it to someone else,' said Peters, who declined to say how much money she invested with Price. 'But you don't feel any justice or closure, because I'm still struggling to make ends meet.' Caught: The banker was picked up on New Year's Eve during a routine traffic stop in Brunswick, Georgia, after cops cited him because the windows of his 2001 Dodge Ram truck were tinted too dark . Michael Smith, who recalled Price coming to dinner at his home and leading a prayer before each meal, said he lost more than $894,000. He applauded Judge B. Avant Edenfield's sentence as just, but added, 'I don't think we'll ever see a dime.' Price's sentence requires him to pay back investors as best he can, though the exact sum remains unclear. Prosecutors said Tuesday the latest estimate was more than $45 million. A federal receiver appointed by the courts to recoup assets says Price has been cooperating. The receiver reported July 30 that about $3.3 million had been collected, but that includes $1.8 million in life insurance payments that the insurers are trying to take back. Price insisted he's as broke as his former clients. Prosecutor Brian Rafferty said there's no evidence he pocketed any of his victims' money. 'The reason he's here is his own arrogance, his own pride prevented him from admitting, then or now, that he just wasn't very good' at investing, Rafferty said . Meanwhile, Price's wife and children sent letters to the judge asking for mercy, though none could explain his actions. When he vanished in June 2012, Price left his family and others long letters that strongly hinted he planned to commit suicide by drowning himself. He was last seen boarding a ferry in Florida. It was Price's wife who got a Florida judge to declare him dead in December 2012. The family he left behind: Betrayal: Rebekah and her four children have had to deal with the shame of his crimes, abuse from those he conned but  admits the kids are happy that their father is alive after all . Raid: Price raised $40million from more than 100 investors in Georgia and Florida through an unregistered investment fund that he managed . Web: Price allegedly forged bank documents to hide the millions of loses his investors suffered, so that they would continue giving him money . Spotted: This June 2012 file photo released by the FBI shows Aubrey Lee Price in Key West shortly before he disappeared . Green: Pot head: Marijuana plants were growing inside the rented home that Price was living in on the run. Over 200 plants were discovered in the home he rented in Georgia, after his arrest . Rebekah Price wrote that her husband of 23 years was dragged down by a deep depression in 2011, after he was involved in purchasing the Montgomery Bank & Trust. 'The strong, secure man that I knew became very fragile and emotional,' Price's wife wrote. '... I cannot explain why he made the choices he did, but I know that he was under more stress than anyone I had ever seen.' John Robert Anderson, a Baptist minister, said he first came to know Price as a talented youth pastor his church hired in 1989. Price told the judge it was a decade later that he became an investment adviser, though his family warned him dabbling with Wall Street would be 'the start of my road to hell.'\n",
      "244. Patrick Coppeard, 49, a former managing director at Merrill Lynch, conned friends out of more than £5.4million in a Ponzi scam . A retired City banker who cheated churchgoers out of millions in a vast fraud told one victim over the phone: ‘God has told me to give you a ring.’ Over five years Patrick Coppeard collected nearly £5.4million, most of which he blew in online gambling while trying to make up for losses. When he finally handed himself into police and was asked how much he had left in his account, the former broker for investment bank Merrill Lynch replied: ‘Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.’ The married father of three, a former magistrate, has now been jailed for six years after admitting a single charge of fraud by abuse of position. He had already moved out of his £1.25million house in Loughton, Essex, and into a more modest home near Harlow. Victims, many left virtually penniless by the scam, complained yesterday that the sentence was ‘pathetic’. David Jacques, 53, a fellow member of St John’s Church in Buckhurst Hill, said he was phoned by Coppeard two days after selling his house. ‘He told me, “David, you may not believe this but God has asked me to give you a ring”,’ Mr Jacques said. ‘He guaranteed the money himself and offered me 6 per cent interest.’ The power-wash business owner invested £50,000 before ploughing another £283,000 into the bogus scheme. He added: ‘I’d known him for 20 years from church. I knew he was a financial man and a magistrate so I trusted him. I’m now saddled with a £33,000 credit card debt … I think the sentence is pathetic for what he’s done.’ Another victim, former next-door neighbour Rob Smith, 50, said Coppeard had been one of his closest friends before the ‘immense betrayal’. ‘We thought we were investing into a share trading club and Patrick was handling it on our behalf due to his experience as a stockbroker,’ he said. The retired business owner added: ‘He had all the credentials – magistrate, church warden, successful stockbroker … That’s why people trusted him.’ Coppeard retired from Merrill Lynch in 2000 due to kidney disease and got into financial trouble after losing £1million of his own money following the banking collapse of 2007. Many of his victims were parishioners at St John's Church in Buckhurst Hill, Essex - the same church that hosted the funeral of reality TV star Jade Goody in 2009 . Coppeard has since moved out of his £1.25 million six-bedroom house in Loughton, Essex, (above) to a more modest property on the outskirts of Harlow, Essex . David Jaques, one of Coppeard's victims, was told that 'God has told me to give you a ring' when he started looking for an investment . In a bid to recover his position he began persuading people to hand over money which he used for spread betting and online gambling. The huge fraud, known as a Ponzi scheme, ran from January 2008 to May last year and took in the church and 61 individuals, who handed over a total of £5,356,497, of which £3,382,000 was lost. Coppeard, who resigned as a magistrate last year, managed to keep the scheme afloat by making occasional payouts to some investors. Days before handing himself in to police, in May last year, he was telling some victims he could double their money in days. Peter Gair, prosecuting, told Chelmsford Crown Court Coppeard ‘effectively jumped before he was pushed’, adding: ‘In recent weeks and days he was being chased by a number of his victims for payment.’ Victims are likely to receive just 10p for every pound invested when a proceeds of crime hearing takes place next year, the court heard. Coppeard’s wife, Irene, 53, is understood to be standing by him. Judge Anthony Goldstaub told Coppeard: ‘You attempted to square the circle in a dead market by spread betting and [online] casino gambling. This was always bound to fail – the house having the benefit of the odds. ‘Upon the good work you did and your excellence of character you constructed a web of financial deceit … you trapped a mass of trusting and vulnerable people … [who] believed in you and you brought them to financial ruin.’ Detective Constable John Vickers said: ‘Coppeard preyed on his closest friends and family for his own gain. He has devastated the lives of a considerable number of people.’ A spokesman for St John’s Church said members were ‘distressed’ to see a fellow Christian in such a ‘predicament’.\n",
      "245. Guilty: Ian Ousey leaving Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court today after he admitted defrauding the makers of the X Factor of £225,000 . A former executive at the company behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent is facing jail after stealing £225,000 to buy a Mediterranean holiday home. Ian Ousey, who was chief financial officer at television production company FremantleMedia, siphoned off funds by submitting false invoices between 2008 and 2012 to make payments on a property in Corsica. Ousey, 51, was caught only when senior colleagues noticed huge shortfalls in the company’s finances and launched an audit. Probes were also made over suspected bogus claims on Ousey’s company credit card, but the matter was dropped when investigators failed to distinguish legitimate claims from potentially fraudulent ones. He has since paid back the full amount he stole, as well as £1million to cover the cost of FremantleMedia’s internal inquiry. He is also believed to have surrendered his full pension to the company. Yesterday, Ousey, who lives in a £1.9million five-bedroom detached home in Ascot, Berkshire, was warned he could be facing a prison sentence after pleading guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court, North London, to fraud by abuse of position involving £224,754. Defence solicitor Samuel Parish said Ousey, who has children in private school, began taking money from the company accounts when he could not afford payments on the holiday home. He told the court: ‘He’s been to Corsica with his wife, he’s decided to buy a property which he had to pay for in instalments. ‘At the last stretch there was some hiccup and he was unable to make the final instalment. The conditions were such that if he was unable to pay he would have lost the whole lot. ‘He submitted a false invoice for a company that did not exist but which had a similar name to a company that did supply to [FremantleMedia]. ‘He’s stated that he couldn’t stop, but he’s paid everything back.’ Home: Ousey, 51, lives in a £1.9million detached six-bedroom house in Ascot, Berkshire (pictured above) FremantleMedia, which co-owns The X Factor and Got Talent franchises with Simon Cowell, also makes other popular TV shows such as Take Me Out and Grand Designs. Mr Parish added: ‘This matter came to light as a result of Mr Ousey making a statement to his employers and he paid back every penny, including investigation costs getting on for £1million. ‘He’s a man with children in paid schools, and his whole way of life has gone completely. ‘He can’t get a job, he’s had to inform his professional body and has been struck off their rolls. ‘And now what he is most worried about is the welfare of his family, because he’s left them in really difficult circumstances.’ Ousey was Chief Financial Officer of FreemantleMedia Group, which makes Simon Cowell's X Factor (pictured) and other major shows like American Idol, Take Me Out and Grand Designs . Suspicious transactions, which also involved the company credit card as well as bogus invoices, were discovered in 2012 by FremantleMedia’s group financial director Mark Riddleston. The company credit card was also used to pay for vehicles, mobile phones and other unauthorised expenses. Ousey, who graduated in economics and statistics from the University of Exeter, spent more than a decade in senior finance roles in the TV industry. He trained at accounting firm PwC in the 1980s before taking a job in Monaco with Grundy Worldwide, the Australian production company behind Neighbours, the long-running daytime soap opera. Offices: Ousey worked at FreemantleMedia Group's HQ (pictured) at 1 Stephen Street in central London . Ousey then went on to work for the European entertainment giant RTL when it bought out Grundy, and then FremantleMedia when the companies merged. After leaving the company last year, he was made redundant from a rival firm in April and then worked as a self-employed consultant. On his online social networking LinkedIn profile, he describes himself as ‘a highly experienced CFO, with a reputation for significant contribution to the business, and delivering the best commercial outcome’. Ousey was released on conditional bail, which included handing the court his passport, and will be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court at a date yet to be set.\n",
      "246. A woman has been found guilty of people trafficking after she forced two Nigerian women into prostitution by making them eat snakes in an African black magic ceremony. Lizzy Idahosa, 24, and her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, made more than £70,000 out of the women, who were terrified with voodoo and made see a witchdoctor for a sinister 'juju' ceremony. Both are now facing jail after Idahosa was convicted of trafficking the women, inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property, while Omoruyi was found guilty of money laundering. Couple: Lizzy Idahosa, 24, found guilty of people trafficking after she forced two Nigerian women into prostitution by making them eat snakes in an African black magic ceremony, while her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, was convicted of money laundering . During the couple's trial at Cardiff Crown Court, the jury was told that the two  victims, aged 23 and 29, had their pubic hair shaved and forced to eat live snakes and snails as part of the ritual, and then flown to Britain in the belief that they were going to find a better life. However, when they arrived in the UK they were put to work as prostitutes, working in brothels at massage parlours across England and Wales. They were told they had to give all the money they earned to Idahosa, and believed the black magic curses would make them go insane or die if they refused. 'The couple were involved in the exploitation of two women brought into the UK from Nigeria to work as prostitutes,' said Caroline Rees, prosecuting, during the trial. 'They were bound to this by something called a juju ritual. It was a ceremonial ritual used to full effect to terrify both women into doing what was demanded of them. 'It was used to ensure compliance, secrecy, and they believed if they broke the bond dire consequences would follow: illness, madness, infertility or death. Facing jail: Heavily pregnant Idahosa (left) and Omoruyi (right) were both told they could expect lengthy prison sentences for their part in the trafficking . 'They genuinely believed the powers would work.' The offences came to light after police arrested a 23-year-old Nigerian woman at the Ambassador Suite brothel in Cardiff, in June 2013. She told officers she had been living rough in Nigeria after her mother died and had wanted to travel to the UK to find her father. She had then met a woman, claiming to be Idahosa’s sister, who promised to make arrangements for her to travel to London, and as part of the agreement had to take part in the ceremony. 'She did not know what was expected of her,' said Ms Rees, who said the woman had been able to pass through immigration at Heathrow. Investigation: The offences came to light after police arrested a 23-year-old Nigerian woman at the Ambassador Suite brothel in Cardiff, in June 2013 . 'She was taken to a premises full of women dressed in their underwear. There was no explanation as to what was going on but it soon became clear.' The woman started to work as a prostitute and was forced to have sexual intercourse with seven or eight men every day, working in brothels across the UK, including in Cardiff and Swansea. When interviewed, she claimed she had given Idahosa £45,000. The second victim told the court she had paid the defendants £31,400 over two years after working in brothels in Cardiff, Swansea, Barking and East Croydon, and said she had worked in South Wales for a year and eight months. The woman, who like her fellow victim cannot be named for legal reasons, said she had stopped working and changed her sim card so Idahosa could not contact her. However, within a month she received a phone call from her mother in Nigeria. 'I had a call from my mum who told me Lizzy’s people had been to her house and threatened her,' the victim told the jury. 'Lizzy said if I did not pay her she would kill my mum and make me go mad.' Idahosa and Omoruyi, who were arrested at their home in London, denied any wrong doing. But police checked their bank accounts and found a series of transfers with Omoruyi acting as a 'financial middle man'. Idahosa had denied forcing the women to take part in a black magic ceremony, but claimed that she herself had been trafficked into the UK and forced to work as a prostitute. She told the jury she did not know the two women had been trafficked. 'It was only when I told them I was trafficked into the country that I found out they were trafficked,' she said. Idahosa, who is heavily pregnant, said she made an oath with her trafficker before leaving Nigeria and was forced to eat the roast heart of a cockerel. She said: 'I wouldn’t do the things they say I did because I’ve been through it.' The jury was told that cash payments of several hundred pounds a time had been deposited into Omoruyi’s account from locations all over the country, including Glasgow, Sheffield and Southampton. Trial: A jury at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) took just five hours to find the couple guilty after the trial . He had claimed that money came from his friend. 'I am the kind of person who likes clothes and shoes and I’m known for that - I like to find bargains,' he said. 'It is not that it is any fraud money or anything. My account has not been used for anything like that.' During an interview with police, he said: 'I am here to say I do not even know the people you are talking about - I have never seen them. 'I have never involved myself in that kind of activity in this country, even before this country. I have not and I would not,' he had claimed. Idahosa was convicted of a total of eight counts including trafficking two women into and around the UK, inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property. Omoruyi was convicted of two offences of money laundering. A jury at Cardiff Crown Court took just five hours to find them guilty. Both were remanded in custody today to be sentenced next month, but judge Tom Crowther QC warned them they will face lengthy custodial sentences. Speaking after the verdicts had been given, Ms Rees said: 'This was a despicable and callous crime. 'These two defendants were involved in an elaborate deception, taking advantage of cultural and financial issues in order to gain a devastating hold over their vulnerable victims. 'Once the victims had entered the UK, they were exploited and abused in the most brutal manner. Human trafficking is totally unacceptable in our society. 'I hope today’s convictions will send a clear message that those who seek to degrade and demean others for their own personal gain can expect to be pursued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. 'It took an immense amount of courage for the victims to come forward and seek to break free from their ordeal. I hope that their courage will act as an inspiration for others who may find themselves in a similar position. 'Whilst we cannot undo what has already happened to these victims, we can hope that today’s convictions will help them as they try to move on from their ordeal.' A spokesman for the Home Office, which led the investigation, said: 'Trafficking is an appalling crime that has no place in today’s society but, as this case has shown, it is taking place here. 'That is why we are taking action on a number of fronts. 'We are working with law enforcement overseas, the law is being strengthened and the Modern Slavery Bill, one of the first of its kind in the world, will make it easier to prosecute the criminals behind trafficking and improve the protection of victims.'\n",
      "247. Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has admitted paying a banker £27million to stay silent over the tycoon's complex financial affairs. The billionaire had previously denied making any payment to Gerhard Gribkowsky, the German banker at the centre of a huge fraud trial. But yesterday he admitted to a packed Munich courtroom that he had paid him around £27million – because he was being blackmailed. Bernie Ecclestone (left) admitted paying Gerhard Gribkowsky (right) over his complex financial affairs despite his earlier denial . He claimed Gribkowsky was threatening to make false accusations to the Inland Revenue about his tax affairs which would cost him 'billions' even though he was innocent. Prosecutors have accused Mr Ecclestone, the fourth richest man in Britain, of paying the banker to fix a deal involving the sale of F1 shares on terms which were favourable to him. As a result of the deal arranged by Gribkowsky, Mr Ecclestone was paid five per cent commission – or £27million. But the F1 boss said a payment of £27million he subsequently made to Gribkowsky was because of the blackmail. Mr Ecclestone said he paid the banker the money not to do 'silly things'. He told the court: 'I really did not have any alternative. 'I was under the impression he might have given some information to the Revenue in England which I did not know much about. If he had done and the Revenue had investigated and been successful it would have been extremely expensive.' He added: 'My fear was he would do something. I thought I could keep him peaceful and quiet and not do silly things.' Ecclestone with his daughter, Tamara. His admission raises further questions about the flamboyant billionaire whose finances have long been shrouded in mystery . The admission that Mr Ecclestone, 81, . paid Gribkowsky will raise further questions about the business affairs . of the flamboyant billionaire, which have always been shrouded in . mystery. The tycoon has not been charged with any offence but his admission places him at the heart of the corruption case. It centres around the 2005 sale of F1 . shares by Gribkowsky's former employer, the German bank BayernLB, to . the London-based private equity group Citicorp Venture Capital, CVC. Gribkowsky, who engineered the deal, was charged with fraud after he was . found to have £27million in an Austrian bank account following the . deal's completion. Prosecutors claim this money was . given to him by Ecclestone as a bribe for securing favourable terms for . the F1 boss. Mr Ecclestone denies this. Following the sale of BayernLB's F1 . stake to CVC, Mr Ecclestone was appointed chief executive of the equity . group and was able to retain his controlling influence over F1.

      "248. Two conmen have been found guilty of persuading a woman to hand over £174,000 as part of a string of frauds against lonely hearts. A three-week trial at Winchester Crown Court heard how Suzanne Hardman was persuaded into handing over the cash after she was duped when responding to a false profile of an 'attractive middle-aged man' on the match.com website. Today, Monty Emu, 28, from Southsea in Hampshire and Adewunmi Nusi, from Berkshire were convicted of money laundering. Scroll down for video . Suzanne Hardman, who was conned out of £174,000 after she was duped on the dating website match.com by a false profile . The court heard how once the conmen developed a relationship with their victims, using the fake name James Richards, they then started to request cash. At first the women were asked for a £700 legal fee by a fake solicitor but then the sums requested rose to up to £100,000. One of the defendants, Adewunmu Nusi, who today was found guilty of money laundering following a three-week trial . The court was told that vulnerable women were conned out of £220,000 in total. The scam included a fictitious lawyer, Rod Thompson of ‘Quality Solicitors’, fake court documents and tax clearance certificates. During the trial, Ms Hardman, from Basingstoke, sobbed as she told the court how she was duped by a 'James Richards', who told her his mother had recently died. She said: 'He was very sociable, we got on, like a friendship. I learnt a bit about his background, I told him a bit about mine. She said that after they had been communicating for about 11 months, 'James Richards' told her that his dead father had a frozen account in India with £1.5million in it. He also told her that he intended to sell a number of properties owned by his father. On the first day of the trial, Emmanuel Oko, 29, Southsea, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and money laundering and Chukwuka Ugwu, 28, also of Southsea, admitted money laundering. Brooke Boston, 28, of Southsea, was cleared of charges of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering. A sixth person, Eberechi Ekpo, 26, of Southsea, was cleared of money laundering and fraud by false representation part-way through the trial. Simon Edwards, prosecuting, told jurors that messages of love and 'overblown affection' were sent to the victims through the match.com website before moving on to emails and text messages. Examples of the messages sent to multiple recipients included: 'You make me feel loved, you make me feel safe, most importantly you make me feel wanted. 'I knew our friendship would grow from the first day we spoke but neither one of us could imagine the love exploding, no thundering into our hearts.' Another read: 'Honey, seriously I love you because I have never been loved by anyone like you loved me. 'I feel like a complete man. The thought of your hands on my body, particularly when you hold me when I am sleeping. 'I love your generous kindness to me. I love your eye and lips, your sense of self-love. I want to be with you now.' This email reveals how the women were bombarded with messages where 'James' declared his love for them but also mentioned problems that would be solved by their cash . Following the case, prosecutors now say they will now be pursuing those convicted to strip them of their ill-gotten gains. Detective Constable Darrin Carey of Hampshire Constabulary said: 'This case centres around a web of lies constructed by a devious group of people with the sole intention of exploiting emotionally vulnerable women for financial gain. 'All members of this group played their part in these offences, which left nine women feeling used and embarrassed and has seen them lose significant amounts of money. 'The women were duped into thinking that they were talking to a man who was genuinely looking for love on the dating website match.com. Unfortunately for them, they were part of an elaborate scam. 'These verdicts should send out a clear message to people who think they can hide behind fake profiles and carry out these scams again and again, that they will be caught and dealt with by the courts. 'I would like to thank the women involved in this case for their courage in coming forward to report this and also for going through the distressing experience of giving evidence about a very personal subject.' The men were accused of using a fake profiles set up on match.com - mainly with the name James Richards - and then gradually swindled cash from vulnerable women . While Simon Edwards of the Crown Prosecution Service added: 'We hope that with these convictions the victims in this case who lost a considerable amount of money and, understandably, could have lost confidence in themselves, will be able to move on with their lives now that the offenders have been brought before the court. 'We will now apply to the court for the ill-gotten assets to be confiscated.' All four face sentencing on the week of October 13.\n",
      "249. A former MI6 spy is being investigated by police on suspicion of defrauding a woman involved in one of the most costly and toxic divorce cases in British legal history. Michelle Young, 50, fought her ex-husband Scot, for eight years through 65 separate court hearings, at a cost to her of £6.5million, to try and secure a share of his fortune which she claimed exceeded £770million. Mr Young, a former property and telecoms tycoon, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle with his former wife but said he lost his entire fortune in a disastrous property deal that left him £28million in debt. At the conclusion of Michelle and Scot Young's marathon divorce case, she was awarded £20m . Michelle Young fought her ex-husband Scot, for eight years through 65 separate court hearings, at a cost to her of £6.5million, to try and secure a share of his fortune which she claimed exceeded £770million . The couple once socialised in a super-wealthy league that included Sir Philip Green, Simon Cowell and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. As their relationship was played out in court it was claimed Mr Young spent up to £5,000 a night eating out, that they went to a Raymond Blanc restaurant twice a week, that Mr Young paid up to £4million for 'a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat' and she had jewellery which Mr Young said cost a million pounds. It was also said that they went on three to four foreign holidays a year, staying in villas and presidential suites. The couple enjoyed a luxury lifestyle - pictured here on a runway in Barbados after their flight on Concorde . The couple were married in 1995 but it resulted in one of the most toxic and bitter divorces battles . But the tycoon's empire went into meltdown and he was declared bankrupt in 2010 and last year, after repeatedly refusing to produce financial documents, was jailed for six months for contempt of court. Ms Young maintains that he has squirrelled his assets offshore. In the end, the judge, Mr Justice Moor, agreed with her that 'he is not a penniless man of straw'. He decreed that Scot had a net fortune of £40 million and should therefore give Ms Young £20million. However one year on, she has yet to receive a penny and continues to fight for it. As such, she was forced to draw on the help of outside agencies to enforce her judgement order. Ms Young has yet to receive any of the money she was awarded and so paid £14,000 for information on her ex husband from Mark-Hill Wood, who worked for 25 years for GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service . Scot Young, a property and telecoms tycoon, pictured with his model and TV presenter girlfriend Noelle Reno . She was contacted in July by Mark Hill-Wood, who worked for 25 years for GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service before setting up his own private detective agency, Full-Proof Intelligence. His LinkedIn page describes him as a 'highly respected operative who formerly worked in the Intelligence Services' and he specialises in cyber investigations, firearms training and 'suspect interrogation.' According to the Independent on Sunday, Mr Hill-Wood told Ms Young that he had come across some of her former husband's hidden wealth in a Swiss bank account while working on an assignment in Russia. He therefore persuaded Ms Young to pay him £14,000 for the information, which she managed to raise through one of her previous litigation funders. Ms Young - who says she cannot work because running her legal case is a full-time job - is currently surviving on benefits to support her two daughters, Scarlet and Sasha. At one point Ms Young begged Mr Hill-Wood to hand over the information he claimed to have regarding her ex husband's hidden wealth in a Swiss bank account, saying 'I feel like crying, I'm under so much pressure' Mr Hill-Wood, who attended Marlborough College and Oxford University, said he would travel to Russia himself to recover the documentary evidence. However, suspicions were raised when another employee of FullProof Intelligence emailed Ms Young to say Mr Hill-Wood had been captured by the Russian authorities who were going to hold him until another £15,000 was raised. Ms Young refused and Mr Hill-Wood eventually emailed to say he had been released. By the end of July, Mr Hill-Wood claimed he had returned to the UK with 'two lever-arch files' of material that supposedly detailed Mr Young's offshore wealth. However he repeatedly cancelled meetings with her and her QC where he was supposed to hand it over. At one point, Ms Young emailed, begging him to hand it over, saying: 'I feel like crying, I'm under so much pressure.' However, the information never materialised and eventually Ms Young reported Mr Hill-Wood to the police. A senior Surrey Police source confirmed an investigation into alleged fraud was under way, but refused to comment, citing operational reasons. The divorce battle between Michelle and Scot Young was one of the most high profile in British legal history .\n",
      "250. With an enormous light show, giant Santas and lots of sparkle, Tesco's 2014 Christmas offering is everything we have come to expect from their annual advert. But this year the company will be hoping the ad does more than boost Christmas sales as they attempt to claw back from a year that has seen them hit with scandal and massive financial losses. Shares in Tesco have plummeted in recent months as the supermarket issued three profits warnings and is facing an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations that bosses inflated profits by £250million. The ad opens with a father searching for the Christmas decorations in the attic, much to the delight of his sons . Hoping to prove they still put the customer first and are in touch with the average British family this year's advert focuses on the simple pleasures that come from out festive preparation. The moving advert begins with a father rummaging around the attic looking for boxes of decorations from last year, while his children wait eagerly downstairs. One by one we see families gathering to decorate their homes, while Tesco workers prepare to spread Christmas cheer. Scroll down for video . Focusing on the simple pleasures of Christmas, a man is seen battling the inevitable light tangle . The ad builds to the moment when Christmas lights are switched on in households and Tesco stores across the country. Tesco will be hoping that the show of community spirit and impressive light display in the advert, for which Tesco enlisted the services of Wieden and Kennedy London, the company behind the light show at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, will go some way to mend their damaged public image. The group has formally been placed under criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) following its discovery of a £263 million black hole in profit expectations. Following the allegations, eight of Tesco's executives have been suspended and last month the supermarket revealed its half-year profits had slumped 91 per cent to £112m. The bank has already set aside £240million for customers who were miss-sold payment protection insurance. The company even went so far as to force executives to shop and cook to get them in touch with customers. New chief executive Dave Lewis also has spoken of his wish to to make head office staff spend one day a fortnight in stores in a bid to stop customers deserting for German discounters Aldi and Lidl and to sweep away a culture at Tesco that included operating six corporate jets. As well as families across the UK we see Tesco staff getting ready for Christmas in store . Two siblings are seen rejoicing when the Christmas tree lights are switched on in a moving moment . Perhaps attempting ot show that it still puts the customer first, the festive light show at the end of this year's advert is inspired by a Tesco customer, Claire Hannah, who last year tweeted her disappointment that her local store in didn't have a green hat. In response Tesco created a winter wonderland at the store and invited Claire and over 800 local residents to enjoy the festivities and turn on the Christmas lights. The show, which culminates with the green hat being placed on the store, was created by the people behind the light show at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony. Nearly one million LED lights covered a huge 78m long and 7.2m high screen in front of the store. The full light show and the crowd's reaction can be seen in an additional film that Tesco is publishing on YouTube for customers. The advert made its debut on Sunday night during the season finale of ITV's Downton Abbey, ensuring that thousands across Britain saw it and marking the end of a week which has seen John Lewis, Argos, Marks and Spencer and Asda also reveal their Christmas campaigns. The ad builds to the moment when Christmas lights are switched on across the country, even by the sea . As well as the advert the store have launched their 'Every Little Helps Make Christmas' campaign . In addition to the advert, Tesco is launching a campaign, 'Every Little Helps Make Christmas,' which will celebrate the excitement around Christmas and focus on helping the nation celebrate. Their iconic green hat  will appear on over 700 Tesco stores across the country, more than ever before. Jill Easterbrook, Chief Customer Officer at Tesco says: 'Christmas is a wonderfully special time of year and we want to help customers in whatever way we can. Claire's experience is just one example of how we're doing every little thing we can to help make Christmas in fun and helpful ways. We're with our customers every step of the way through the festive season!' The festive light show at the end is inspired by a Tesco customer, Claire Hannah, who last year tweeted her disappointment that her local store didn't have a green hat . The delighted crowd in Wigan react to the light display which features one million LED lights covered a huge 78m long and 7.2m high screen in front of the store . Claire Hannah says, 'I was taken aback when Tesco first approached me - I couldn't believe my tweet had been noticed. It's amazing, Tesco has done a really lovely thing for the town, and I'm so chuffed our Tesco has the green hat this year!' Ray Shaughnessy, Creative Director at Wieden and Kennedy London says, 'This year's campaign is an important step change for Tesco in that they are doing all sorts of unexpected things to help people have a brilliant Christmas. 'It won't just be about them making sure you get the best turkey on the table, it will be about making sure that people feel Christmassy too. Getting the team behind the London 2012 Olympic light show to light up Wigan is a great example of this.'

      "251. Bloated beyond recognition, with his long hair dyed blond and sporting a grey goatee, notorious conman Peter Foster – a former friend of Cherie Blair – was dramatically arrested in Australia yesterday after a year on the run. His dishevelled appearance was a stark contrast to the sharp figure he cut while promoting his worthless Bai Lin Tea slimming products in Britain more than 30 years ago. The 52-year-old self-confessed ‘international man of mischief’, who later became the central figure in the infamous 2002 Cheriegate scandal, was pounced on by police at his hideout near the New South Wales holiday town of Byron Bay. Scroll down for video . Peter Foster, 52, was arrested in Byron Bay on Tuesday afternoon . Footage shows the man with long grey hair, a ragged beard, and barefoot . Footage shows officers arresting the wanted man, who has let his hair and beard grow long and grey . As they wrestled him to the ground one of the officers was heard to warn his colleagues: ‘He’s got a gun!’ In fact, Foster was unarmed. He was quickly subdued and dragged away to a police van – but the first stop wasn’t a police cell. Instead, the fugitive was taken to hospital after he suffered what a police spokesman described as ‘a turn’, the nature of which was not known, while being arrested. Foster is expected to appear before a Brisbane court in the next few days to face a sentencing hearing for his involvement in a weight loss scheme – he is banned from taking part in any such schemes in Australia. A Queensland judge has already decided he will go to jail for three years. But because Foster failed to appear in court for the sentencing hearing late last year and was judged to be in contempt of court, after which he remained ‘on the run’ for a year, he is certain to be ordered to serve added jail time. The man who made millions of pounds by selling franchises for weight-loss products – which were found in scientific tests to be ineffective – first made headlines in Britain in the 1980s when he dated models and even took one on a six-month tour of Europe in a Rolls-Royce. Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry . He looked dramatically different on Tuesday when he was captured by a number of officers on the NSW coast . Footage from his arrest on Tuesday shows officers surrounding the wanted man before pinning him to the ground . In 2002 Cherie Blair, wife of of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the Australian conman . Later he began an affair with Cherie Blair’s fitness ‘guru’ Carole Caplin. It was through Miss Caplin that he agreed to help the-then Labour Prime Minister’s wife to purchase two flats in Bristol for a discounted price. It resulted in Mrs Blair sending him an email saying he was ‘a star’. When she learned of his notoriety, she tearfully admitted her mistake in public. Foster has boasted to the Daily Mail that he has been in prison in Britain, the US and Australia but insisted he had never been convicted of fraud. Rather, he said, he had been found guilty of advertising misdemeanours. During his time in Britain, he befriended Carole Caplin, Cherie Blair’s fitness 'guru' which is how he came to get close to the Blair family . He was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US. Convictions in the past did not stop him continuing to be involved in the weight loss industry in Australia and he found himself behind bars again, this time in Queensland. On being freed, he became a silent partner in another weight loss scam and was due to be sentenced last year when he disappeared - only to post photos of himself enjoying kava in Fiji. Or so it seemed. But reports began to emerge that he had been seen in northern New South Wales - and now it appears that those reports had foundation, with his arrest near Byron Bay. Foster was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US . Having heard Foster boast of his ability to date beautiful women, his former lawyer Sean Cousins has described him as a ‘narcissistic psychopath’. When he heard that Foster had been arrested, Mr Cousins, who has claimed that the conman has threatened him over the phone, said last night that he was relieved. He told the Gold Coast Bulletin that he had always believed Foster was living near Byron Bay and not in Fiji as the conman had claimed with a series of internet photos allegedly showing him in the Pacific nation. ‘I think it is sad that it has taken police so long to find him,’ said Mr Cousins. ‘I understood that he had a friend rent a couple of houses for him and he has been hopping between the two for months.’ The Daily Mail revealed in 2002 that Cherie Blair had used Australian conman Peter Foster to obtain a discount on two luxury flats in Bristol for her. There were strong denials from the Blairs that they even knew Foster, but the lie was laid bare when on December 5 the Mail published a series of emails between Foster and Mrs Blair discussing the purchase of the flats. Cherie Blar, pictured with Carole Caplin, who at the time was in a relationship with Peter Foster . Foster, who was involved in an affair with Mrs Blair’s fitness ‘guru’ Carole Caplin at the time, told the Prime Minister’s wife he had managed to get a £69,000 discount, adding: ‘Let me know if I can be of service ... as I tell Carole, your pleasure is my purpose.’ He went on to tell Mrs Blair that the mortgage could be handled by his accountant who ‘will not charge you for his services as I will pay him through my company’. Mrs Blair replied that ‘you are a star’ and later, after meeting him at Miss Caplin’s gym, wrote to him on November 9 telling him that she could not thank him enough for taking the negotiations over for her and hoped they could ‘see each other again soon’. Downing Street initially stated that Foster was not, and had not been, a financial adviser to the Blair family. But after the Mail exposed the emails, Mrs Blair tearfully apologised for denying Foster’s involvement. No 10 said that if Mrs Blair had known of his past she would have been more circumspect. But Foster’s background had been well documented before Cheriegate. In 1994 he was fined £21,000 for a trading standards offence relating to his Bai Lin weight loss tea, and two years later he was jailed for breaching laws regarding distribution of slimming granules. He escaped from prison and went to Australia, where he was extradited to Britain. Later he was jailed in the US for another trading standards offence – and when he returned to Britain in 2000 he was jailed again, briefly, for using fraudulent documents to obtain credit for a slimming cream company.

      "252. The financial drama at Leeds has taken a new twist, with lawyers representing the club’s former managing director, David Haigh, writing to the Football League to say he can provide information relating to serious allegations about the club’s co-owner, Gulf Finance House (GFH), in its purchase of the club in 2012. A letter making the claims, including a potential breach of US Iran sanctions, has been sent to League chief executive Shaun Harvey — who was chief executive at Leeds in 2012 — and the League’s director of legal affairs, Nick Craig. GFH deny wrongdoing and question the credibility of Haigh, 37, who has been held at a Dubai police station without charge since May, accused of misappropriating more than £3m of GFH’s money, for whom he used to work. Lawyers representing David Haigh, who has been held in Dubai since May, have written to the Football League . A GFH spokesman said: ‘We are not aware of this letter and so cannot comment in any detail. We are satisfied GFH has always behaved in an appropriate manner... However, one of our former employees has been subject to both criminal and civil investigation over a variety of possible criminal actions, including fraud and money laundering, during the last few months and we are therefore unable to answer on specifics.’ Haigh was GFH Capital’s front man when they bought Leeds from Ken Bates in late 2012 for around £17million and as such is party to intimate knowledge of the firm’s business. Well-placed sources acknowledge Haigh did indeed receive the funds he is accused of misappropriating from GFH although his defence, whenever it is lodged, will say he was owed the cash in salary, commissions and expenses. Lawyers representing Haigh have written to Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey . Haigh’s new accusations against GFH will run the risk of implicating himself, as a former employee and insider. The letter from Haigh’s lawyers continues: ‘Clearly the information will need to be investigated thoroughly and our client is keen to assist in this process.’ The League have declined to comment but because GFH still owns and/or control 25 per cent of the club, the situation is potentially a huge embarrassment for them as a body and for Harvey personally. Harvey worked at Leeds under GFH until summer 2013. He became the League’s chief executive officer last autumn. A GFH spokesman said: ‘The funds used to acquire Leeds and to support the club was from the GFH group and its clients and not sanctioned Iranian funds, as has been insinuated.’ The letter said Haigh has information relating to serious allegations about the club’s co-owner, Gulf Finance Hous, in its purchase of the club in 2012 .\n",
      "253. During the 1990s, financial adviser to the stars Dana Giacchetto lived like the punk-rock prince of New York City who by his own admission, 'flew too close to the sun and spun out of control.' His palace was a mammoth SoHo penthouse where he hosted drug-fueled orgies witnessed by a pair of cockatoos named Angel and Tiberius - one each for him and his best-friend, Leonardo DiCaprio. At the height of his rebel-reign, he and the then 23-year-old star of Titanic defiantly watched the 1998 Academy Awards at his Manhattan apartment, while over in  Los Angeles the James Cameron blockbuster won 11 Oscars. Now and then: Dana Giacchetto at the Manhattan Federal Courthouse in February where he is facing fresh fraud charges and (right) at a party in Los Angeles in June 1999 . Best friends: Leonardo DiCaprio enjoys lunch with his one-time pal, Dana Giacchetto in New York in 1998 . 'I was king of the world,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter.. 'We projected the Academy Awards on the wall and had every star come to New York to give the middle finger because we felt the Academy Awards were a complete f---ing sellout and anti-punk rock.' His influence on DiCaprio was such, that he reputedly inspired the Hollywood stars' performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, despite their friendship ending when he pleaded guilty to misappropriating nearly $20 million of his clients' money in 2000. Giacchetto, who is now 51, spent three-years in prison for his fraud after swindling millions from clients who included, R.E.M front man Michael Stipe, Spiderman star Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz and Ben Affleck. Indeed, he was back in court in February facing charges that he used a friend's credit card to rack up $10,045 in charges to buy liquor, a plane ticket and food, according to court filings. But while he vehemently denies that, in new revealing interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he positively revels in the speculation he was his former friends muse for The Wolf of Wall Street. Party time: Dana Giacchetto with tragic super-agent Jay Moloney (left) and Hollywood financier Tom Lassaly (right) in Los Angeles in 1999 . However, unlike trader Jordan Belfort, whose story is told in the Martin Scorcese hit, Giacchetto tries to claim he is not a fraud - despite his conviction. 'I'm the Lamb of Wall Street,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter. 'If I wasn't dragged from an airplane at gunpoint, I would've been able to fix the positions. Whether clients lost money because the market went down or because I was a f—-up, I felt really bad about it. 'I never stole money in my life. Why would I do that to the people that I love?' Inspiration: The muse for DiCaprio's performance in the Martin Scorcese movie The Wolf of Wall Street was allegedly Dana Giacchetto . In 2000, Giacchetto was arrested at Newark Airport, traveling with a fake passport trying to flee the country having admitted fraud involving his incredible list of clients money. Displaying the charisma which no doubt enamored him to talented actors, musicians, directors, artists and Oscar winners, punk-rock fan Giacchetto's big break was brokering the deal for a small underground Seattle record label, Sub Pop, in 1991. On their books was an unknown grunge band named Nirvana, who were tipped for the top. Together with Giacchetto's investment firm, the Cassandra Group, 49-percent of Sub Pop was sold to Warner Music Group in 1994 for $20 million - many times its expected value. By his 37th birthday in 1998, Giacchetto controlled by his estimation, $5 billion in assets - needing to hire a young lawyer called Chris Cuomo, the brother of New York Governor Andrew and current host of CNN's New Day. Armed with success and money, Giacchetto embarked on one huge party - and the celebrity he was indelibly linked to was a young Leonardo DiCaprio. The actor, 12-years Giacchetto's junior, was already on the road to superstardom and spent months living in his friends lavish SoHo apartment. He took him on tours of the New York Stock Exchange and they were frequently spotted at parties together and lunching. Giacchetto told The Hollywood Reporter that he believes he is definitely the inspiration for DiCarpio in The Wolf of Wall Street, although the actor has never mentioned this . Rooftop: Leonardo DiCaprio is seen here in The Wall of Wall Street - more than a decade earlier he was a guest at Giacchetto's penthouse apartment for months at a time . He claims to have been told that when DiCaprio was asked if his old friend was his template, he demurred, 'No, not exactly.' Calling this 'lovely', the convicted fraudster reminisces about the life he led and its similarities to the crazed-lifestyle portrayed in movie. 'I lived it -- not the stealing-money-from-poor-people part. Listen, the sex and the drugs and the decadence in my life was 10 times worse than Wolf, a bacchanalian orgy for 10 years,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter. 'There was sex constantly, there were drugs constantly, but there was no sex without condoms ever that I ever witnessed. There were certain rules, and that was one of those rules.' Like a raging Master of the Universe or Wall Street Jay Gatsby, the tales of Giacchetto's parties are legendary. 'There were lots of weird sex scenes,' says one prominent Giacchetto partygoer to The Hollwyood Reporter. 'The loft had $300 champagne, $5,000 hookers, top models, rockers, actors and artists. There also were two cockatoos, Angel and Tiberius -- one each for Giacchetto and DiCaprio. Friends: Michael Stipe of R.E.M. (left) was one of the fraudsters friends as was Ben Affleck (right with his best friend Matt Damon) 'Victoria Leacock Hoffman, a friend of Andy Warhol, Martin Scorsese and Giacchetto, attended a Christmas party at the loft and later threw Molly Ringwald's 30th birthday party there, both of which she says were fairly tame. 'Leo was always sweet and gentlemanly,' she says. Giacchetto's riotous parties also welcomed Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss, Michael Stipe and Mark Wahlberg - although there are no accounts or suggestions of them partaking in anything nefarious. 'I had all my windows open, and John F. Kennedy Jr. was standing there,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter. 'Everyone's like, 'Don't fall out that f---in' window!' His friendship with DiCaprio was so strong that it went beyond money - he claims to have fallen out with the actor's manager over his career trajectory. 'I had a fight with DiCaprio's then-manager Rick Yorn,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter. 'He wanted Leonardo to make American Psycho,' as did DiCaprio. 'I called Leo's dad, George, I called Leo's mom, Irmelin. I said, 'Leo, if you do this movie, you must move out. Cutting people up? Is that what you're about?' Former partners: Guests at Giacchetto,'s SoHo parties included Johnny Depp and Kate Moss when they were still a couple . Giacchetto also told The Hollywood Reporte about his controversial relationshps with one time Walt Disney Company chief Mike Ovitz and Hollywood superagent, Jay Maloney, who tragically ended his life in November 1999 after problems with depression. 'My performance for so many years was so good and quantitative -- not bullshit, not boiler room, really good -- that I started to get the Ovitzes of the world and the very, very serious heavy-hitter asset managers to say, 'This guy actually f---ing knows how to trade,' said the fraudster. 'He has a gift. He may be a flake, he may be effeminate, but he knows what he's f---ing doing.' I'm some crazy mathematical rock-star wacko who sold Sub Pop and Matador and made a lot of money.' Despite his convictions, Giacchetto denies he was a thief. His problems began when his previously safe investments began to falter in the late 1990s and instead of telling his famous friends, he attempted to cover up his losses. He began moving money from one account to another, but when he was taken into custody on April 12, 2000, he was carrying only $4,000 in tens and fives. Investments: Dana Giacchetto helped broker the deal that sold Sub Pop - who boasted Nirvana and Kurt Cobain on their books to Warner Music in 1994 and hosted JFK. Jr. to one of his parties too . 'I never planned to steal people's money. I got in over my head on deals that lost money. But I never stole.' His friendships with the rich and famous ended - or they did officially according to Giacchetto. 'When I go to Hollywood and see all my old clients, which I do, it's always off the record,' he said to The Hollywood Reporter. 'Even the people that I loved the most, they would answer the phone like, 'I'm afraid to see you,' because Hollywood is so small. Leo, I mean, we only talked through lawyers through the years because we're afraid.' Despite his impending credit card fraud, Giacchetto says that he has found happiness as the father of two children, although their mother has left him. He is friends with heiress and fashionista Daphne Guinness and plays in Manhattan with his band, Element 4. Indeed, his entrepreneurial skills are still strong. He owns a food business called Taste which makes salsa. However, he will always remember the heady days of the late 1990s as witnessed by his 2001 sentencing, when he told the judge, 'I lived in a world of fantasy.' Fallen: The stockbroker-to-the-stars', leaves Manhattan Federal Court following a hearing on charges of wire fraud and access device fraud, Thursday, February, 20, 2014. Giacchetto is a disgraced money manager who palled around with actor Leonardo DiCaprio and other A-listers in the 1990's .\n",
      "254. Gilberto Martinez was . almost penniless when he left Cuba in 2005  to start a new life . in the United States. Eight years later he returned a rich man and built a large . house in his dusty neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana. Flush with money, he drove an Audi and a Mercedes and . started a music career under the artistic name 'Gilbertman'. But . two weeks ago, his flash lifestyle caught up with him when a swarm of Cuban police descended on his home and . arrested him. Boastful: The accused credit card fraudster, Gilberto Martinez, found living in Cuba, poses on Facebook with wads of cash on his biceps . Taking advantage: Like American music producers the videos he appeared in includes guns, strobe lights and scantily clad women . No taste: In the Cuban fugitive's rich video he says 'I have a lot of money in the bank,' he croons while throwing piles of cash around . 'It was dramatic. There were dozens of cops, in cars, sirens . blaring. They blocked off the street,' said one neighbor who . asked not to be identified. It is not clear what charges the 28-year-old Martinez faces . in Cuba but, whatever they are, the U.S. government also wants . to bring him in. Florida court records show he is a fugitive and faces up to . 16 years in prison after he was indicted on Sept. 30 in a Secret . Service credit card fraud probe involving $150,000 of purchases . at stores including Toys'R'Us and Babies'R'Us. In recent years, dozens of Medicare, credit card and . mortgage fraudsters who came to the United States from Cuba have . avoided prosecution by jumping bail and fleeing to their . homeland. Under President Obama's new Cuba policy, the fraudsters, who . have cost U.S. tax payers hundreds of millions of dollars, could . finally come under the long arm of U.S. law. Talks aimed at restoring diplomatic relations after decades . of hostility began this week in Havana, and U.S. officials say . issues of legal cooperation will be raised in the months ahead. Show-off: The young music artist publicly flaunted his riches: a spacious new house, a fleet of motorcycles and luxury cars, designer clothes and stately furniture . Star status: He was wanted in the United States for stealing people's credit card numbers and ripping off stores across Florida . Caught: Cuban police earlier this month raided the gated home of a U.S. fugitive in the town of Guanabacoa, outside Havana . Justice: Cuban officials aren't talking, but pictures and video shot by neighbors show armed, SWAT-like teams standing guard outside Martinez's home . In the past there has been occasional cooperation regarding . low level fugitives, including a Florida couple repatriated in . 2013 after they kidnapped two small sons they had lost custody . of due to a drug arrest and fled to Cuba on a sailboat. 'We would hope to be able to expand some of that cooperation . in the future as more normal relations go forward, and to have, . frankly, a better relationship on that kind of issue,' a senior . State Department official said this week. 'We are starting to compile a list of those fugitives that . we believe may have flown back to their native country,' said . Barry Golden, spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Miami. 'But as you can imagine it's very hard to confirm if they . are there. It's not like we can call the U.S. embassy and ask . them - at least not yet.' Not so in the case of Martinez who posted dozens of photos . of himself in Cuba on social media. 'He's all over YouTube so we . can pretty much verify he is there,' said Golden, who confirmed . that Martinez has an outstanding federal warrant. For days after his arrest, Cuban police were stationed . outside his single story hacienda-style home occupying almost an . entire block, and several officers were seen inside apparently . conducting an inventory. It is not clear why Martinez was arrested or on what charges . and no mention was made of the raid in Cuban media. Cuba's . government does not usually comment on police actions. No tact: Martinez, 28, posted hundreds of pictures of himself on Facebook living in Cuba like a Hollywood celebrity . Arrogance: About a week ago, a Spanish-language station in Miami, featured news of Martinez's arrest, friends and fans on social media  began praising him . Their Cold War animosity means Cuba and the United States . have no extradition agreement or law enforcement cooperation . treaty, although that could change once diplomatic relations are . restored. Despite their differences, the two countries have for long . cooperated on immigration issues and drug trafficking. But . building closer law enforcement ties would still be a huge step . in Cuba's one-party system, where the police and the military . are under the control of the ruling Communist Party. The most prominent political fugitive in Cuba is Joanne . Chesimard who escaped a New Jersey state prison following her . life sentence conviction for killing a state trooper in 1973. But there are a host of others wanted for financial crimes. Since 2007, U.S. authorities have been cracking down on . Medicare fraud, arresting and charging about 2,000 people who . collectively have falsely billed more than $6 billion to the . government health program for the elderly and disabled. Most arrests were made in south Florida, often involving . Cuban immigrants. 'They have got it down to a science ... When they get caught . they know they can skip bail and get away to Cuba. It's their . business model,' said Carlos Fleites, the lawyer for Martinez's . girlfriend, Yuleidys Gonzalez Amaral, who is charged in the same . credit card fraud case. Fleites said the scale of the problem is hard for Cuba to . ignore. 'They have to cooperate somewhat if they want to have a . normal relationship. They know where everybody is on the island. They could round up everyone overnight and fill a plane and have . them in Miami in the morning. Hopefully judgment day is coming.' The FBI provided Reuters with a list of 64 south Florida . Medicare fugitives, all but six from Cuba, though the number . could be higher as some investigations may be under seal. Among them is Jorge Emilio Perez de Morales, wanted on . charges he laundered $238 million stolen from Medicare. Three brothers - Carlos, Jose and Luis Benitez - are accused . of running 11 Miami-Dade county clinics that swindled $110 . million from Medicare. South Florida judges are increasingly taking a harder line . on fraud involving recently arrived Cubans, refusing bond and . imposing tough jail sentences. Last week, federal Judge Federico Moreno ordered Gonzalez . Amaral jailed after she appeared in court on bond to change her . plea to guilty and offered to cooperate with prosecutors. 'There are too many people who have fled,' Moreno said. Lavish lifestyle: Martinez built a large, white house with pool and hot tub, marble floors, and wraparound porch — then walled it off from neighbors . Breaking the rules: Martinez's mistake is that he lived too openly and too ostentatiously for a communist state . Out of time: In the past, Cuban-born criminals escaped to the island with their riches, well out of reach of American authorities - but now the past is catching up to Martinez .\n",
      "255. A computer programmer bragged on Facebook that he was the first person in the world to pirate a copy of the movie Fast & Furious 6 – but was caught after he used his hacker name on his dating profile. Philip Danks, 25, secretly filmed the sixth installment of the Hollywood action movie at a cinema in Walsall, West Midlands, on its UK release date and illegally uploaded it on the internet, costing Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million. Fraud investigators quickly traced him after they noticed his online ‘Thecod3r’ tag attached to the video was identical to his profile on dating site Plenty of Fish. Philip Danks, 25, bragged on Facebook he was the first person to pirate a copy of the Fast and Furious 6 movie . He was arrested by police after a special ‘webwatch’ team was set up by LA-based Universal Pictures, who raided his home in Bloxwich, Walsall on May 23 – less than a week after the video surfaced online. Danks even took to Facebook two days later to brag: ‘Seven billion people and I was the first. F*** you Universal Pictures.’ And while on police bail, he continued to sell dozens of illegal films – including the Fast and Furious 6 – for £1.50 each. He pleaded guilty to three charges of distributing pirate copies of films and was jailed for 33 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday. The court heard he made £1,000 from selling copies of the film but his dealings cost Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million after 779,000 people were able to download it for free. Sentencing Recorder Keith Raynor said: ‘This was bold, arrogant and cocksure offending. ‘You approach to the film industry was made clear in the posting you made on Facebook two days after your arrest. ‘I accept the personal profit was modest but the real seriousness of this case is the loss caused to the film industry as a whole.’ Ari Alibhai, prosecuting on behalf of the Federation Against Copyright Theft, said Danks had recorded the film at a Showcase Cinema in Walsall on May 17, 2013. He then uploaded it onto the internet via his personal website Bit Buddy the following day after converting the pirated camcorder version into a digital copy. Danks (pictured with a sports car similar to those in the film) was caught after investigators found he had used his tag name 'thecod3r' on dating site Plenty of Fish, which listed his real details, and they raided his home . Mr Alibhaid said: ‘The film was Universal Picture's most significant release of that year with both the biggest production costs and expected revenue. ‘The estimated loss to the industry caused by the defendant's actions is conservatively estimated at £2.3m but he did not receive money from the on line distribution.’ The court heard that despite making some money from sales of the film on Facebook and by personal delivery his real motive was ‘street cred’. He added: ‘The first person with a pirated version attracts much kudos. ‘He wanted recognition from the community.’ Danks, who has given lessons on computer programming on YouTube, had to watch the film twice at the cinema on the same day because the camcorder battery ran out on the first visit. He used his Facebook page to brag just two days after his arrest saying that he was the first to pirate the movie - and was still openly posting comments on social media about his conviction up until last month (above) Danks advertised his services through his Facebook page, selling illegal movies individually or in bundles and is said to have made £1,000 from the Fast and Furious movie, costing Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million . His copy had been picked up by ExtraTorrent – one of the world’s largest pirate film sites – and it was spotted by Universal’s webwatch team. Investigators put his distinctive 'tag' into an internet search engine and discovered he had also used it on Plenty of Fish where his proper name and age were also recorded. In his dating profile he describes himself as ‘smokes often with average body type’ and says his personality is a ‘techie’. He also says he is 5ft 10, non-religious and works as a member of bar staff and his longest relationship was less than a year. He was found by investigators on dating site Plenty of Fish where he described himself as a non-smoker of average build, with a 'techie' personality and having worked as a member of bar staff . He uploaded pictures to the site including him singing karaoke with a friend (left) and holding a baby (right) Denks (pictured with orange hair) playing a poker tournament - another one of the pictures on his dating profile . It states: ‘I like to go fishing and play poker when I can. I drive, I work (most of the time). I like listening to R&B, Garage, Bassline, Pop and anything in-between. I like watching comedies and romance films mainly but will watch pretty much anything.’ His computer and three rack servers - needed to download films faster - were seized and taken away for analysis when police raided his home. Mr Christopher Loach, defending, said: ‘He has no real qualifications and is not a man of means.

He had used the same tag 'thecod3r' on both . Showcase Cinema in Walsall where Danks secretly filmed the film before uploading it to his website Bit Buddy . Danks had to visit twice on the same day after the camera he was using ran out of battery the first time round . ‘He has no substantial assets of any sort and his financial gain has been extremely limited but he was obviously aware that it was a popular film that would be of interest.’ A second version of his copy was also uploaded onto the internet under his direction by a friend, Michael Bell. Bell, from Aldridge, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to one offence of distributing a pirate copy of a film and was given a 12 month community order with 120 hours unpaid work . Danks kept people posted on the case through Facebook - where he is seen pictured with fast sport cars similar to those in the film, which starred Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Scenes in the Fast and Furious 6, starring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, were filmed on the streets of Glasgow . On the day before the hearing he posted: ‘Going to try and get some sleep now, 2 important events tomorrow! 1 is to determine my fate and find out if I am going to prison, the other (if court goes well) will be playing in the biggest tournament of my life, a $700 & hopefully a $2100 tournament to fight for a spot in the EPT 11 London Main Event on October 8th! #Nervous’. Makers of the Fast & Furious 6, Universal Pictures, say his actions cos them £2.3million after he filmed the movie on its opening day in UK cinemas . But while awaiting sentence, he conceded in another post: ‘Not loking (sic) good’. After the case Kieron Sharp, director general of FACT said: ‘Thousands of people are employed making some of the world's most famous and popular films. ‘Their livelihoods are at risk if a film is unable to create the profits needed to fund future films. ‘This is an important case and an important sentence. ‘Danks was responsible for recording, uploading and distributing the film and was clearly unconcerned at the time about the consequences of his actions, perhaps believing that the internet gave him anonymity.’ Chris Marcich form the The Motion Picture Association of America said: ‘Online copyright infringement represents a significant threat to the continued success of the UK's creative industries and to the continued development of legal sources of film and TV content. ‘It is important that those making money on the back of other people's hard work and creativity, paying nothing back into the creative economy, are held accountable.’ Detective Sergeant Rod Rose, from West Midlands Police's Economic Crime Unit, added: ‘Fraud comes in many guises and ultimately affects all of us. ‘There are lots of agencies involved in stopping offenders and when they identify potential criminal offences we will always try to offer our support.’\n",
      "256. A man who ran up a $28,000 bar tab during a drunken night out has been told he will have to pay up despite his attempts to sue the bar that served him. William Ilg claimed that the Hustler Club in Manhattan should not have given him the drinks because he was 'no longer capable of conducting financial transactions'. However, the New Yorker's case was thrown out by a judge and adding to what must have already been a terrible hangover, he will now have to pay the credit card bill of $28,109.60. Failed: Mr Ilg filed a lawsuit against Hustler Club in New York, pictured, claiming he was so drunk bar staff should not have served him - but a judge dismissed the case . He filed a lawsuit against the adult chain claiming the Hustler Club had refused to return the money to him, reported the New York Daily News. He stated the club had committed 'a fraud and wrongful conversion' because they wouldn't give him a refund. Mr Ilg’s lawyer Paul Kerson said in the lawsuit that he was also looking for punitive damages after 'outrageous' conduct by the club. But Manhattan Supreme Court Justice . Manuel Mendez dismissed the case saying: 'There is no duty upon (Hustler . Club) to protect the plaintiff from the results of his (voluntary) intoxication.' The judge also threw out another legal action Ilg filed this year claiming the club lacked the proper liquor license.  The . lawsuit follows a separate case filed against the same club last year . by a Delaware man, who also said he was also falsely billed a huge . amount.

      "257. John Kerry, the American Secretary of State, is in Afghanistan to try to broker a deal between the two candidates in last month’s runoff election where both are claiming victory. The dispute between the two men - former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai – is becoming ever more bitter. Preliminary results put the former World Bank economist Ashraf Ghani in the lead with 56.4 per cent of the vote. However, Mr Abdullah has rejected the count. Scroll down for video .

      "258. Criminal gangs from Romania are responsible for a boom in cash machine card thefts. Over the past year the number of thefts related to ATMs has trebled and police intelligence suggests more than 90 per cent are linked to Romanian immigrants. There were some 7,572 cash machine card thefts in the first four months of the year, up from 2,553 during the same period in 2012. Be vigilant: Over the past year the number of thefts related to ATMs has trebled and police intelligence suggests more than 90 per cent are linked to Romanian immigrants . Other card payment machines, such as railway station ticket machines, are also being targeted. The techniques involved are crude yet they can generate huge windfalls, with card fraud for 2013 expected to reach £400million. Gang members using distraction techniques have been behind the rise in cashpoint thefts. The thieves will often crowd round ATMs and read PIN numbers before stealing the card. They are then able to drain the victim's account. Often the elderly and the most vulnerable are the targets. As the number of these distraction thefts has soared, thieves have started deploying the scam in shops, railway stations and cafes. Other thieves use more sophisticated ATM scams - and will fit the machine with a 'skimming' device which will make a copy of the card's details. A wide array of scams that have been deployed at cashpoints across the country include: . Spring traps - Once a card has been inserted, these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the ATM from retracting it. Cash traps - Claw-like implements are inserted into cash-dispensing slot to 'capture or skim some of the dispensed bills'. Jammers - An oversized fork-like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal ATM transaction. Skimmers - Thieves lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic strip readers. The data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and used at ATM along with victim’s PIN to withdraw cash. Transaction reversal fraud - Involves 'tricking' ATM into not debiting some of the cash that has been taken or manipulating the ATM to pay more than the balance available. Can be done via clips or fingers or by removing some notes so machine does not realise it has dispensed them. Gang members will crowd customers withdrawing cash to read their four-digit PIN, then distract them to steal the card. In some cases they install a simple metal sleeve in the slot which means the card is not returned to the user. Someone reads the PIN over the victim’s shoulder and then, when they have moved away, retrieves the card. Once the thieves have the card and PIN they can go on a shopping spree or use a hole in the wall machine to empty their victim’s account. Pensioner Jacqueline Fletcher was . watched by two thieves while she withdrew cash from an ATM outside her . local supermarket in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire. When . the 80-year-old emerged from the shop, one of the men asked her for . change and stole her bank card while pretending to help her with her . purse. ‘It frightened me and . it gutted me to think that I’d been stupid enough and that they’d been . attacking vulnerable people, young or old,’ she said. ‘It’s obvious that they’d seen me as an easy mark.’ Last month a woman in Cheltenham had . her cards stolen in a supermarket car park as she was distracted by a . man asking for directions. She believes the criminals, who siphoned . £1,000 from her account, spotted her using her PIN at a store till. Meanwhile, victims are finding it . increasingly difficult to get their stolen cash refunded. A number of . banks have introduced rules which means they can deny a refund if they . believe the customer has failed to protect their PIN and card. The theft figures were revealed by . Financial Fraud Action, which is responsible for tackling plastic card . fraud on behalf of banks. Chip and PIN cards were introduced by the . industry in 2005 with the aim of reducing fraud. The chip means the cards are difficult to copy, while a PIN is considered more secure than a signature. Card skimming: This cash machine has been fitted with a skimming device which covers the whole right hand side of the machine and is very yard to spot. It reads information from the card's magnetic strip enabling thieves to steal. Card skimming is one of the more sophisticated techniques used by thieves . Another card skimming device: Cover which is put over the slot enabling thieves to clone the card details . Initially . there was a dip in card fraud, however this is now rising again. The . total cost of fraud on debit and credit cards leapt 14 per cent last . year, by £47million to £388million, Fraud is expected to top £400million . this year. The City of London Police’s dedicated . cheque and plastic crime unit calculates that 92 per cent of all cash . machine fraud is committed by Romanian nationals. In March, authorities in Europe . arrested 44 members of a global card fraud network in a joint operation . against a criminal gang targeting victims in Britain and 15 other . countries. The operation, dubbed Pandora Storm, shut down illegal . workshops producing card machine theft devices and involved 82 house . searches in Romania and the UK. In 2008 Romanian fraudster Adu Bunu, was . jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more than 2,000 . cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million. Police found photographs that showed his young son rolling around in a mountain of stolen cash. Cash machine thefts: Thieves read customers' four-digit pin when they are at a cash machine before later stealing the card. The crude technique has also been used by thieves at train station ticket machines and in supermarkets (picture posed by models) Jailed: Romanian fruadster Abu Bunu was jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more than 2,000 cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million . Speaking last year, Commander Steve Head, of City of London Police, said: ‘We can see quite clearly what they are doing with the money back in Romania. They are spending it on a lavish lifestyle, flash cars, flash houses. ‘What sits behind it all is the greed – the greed of the people who are organising it, the greed of the professionals along the way who are enabling it.’ Another scam used by the gangs see them calling people at home pretending to be from the security department of their bank. They warn their card details have been stolen and run through a series of security questions, including asking their target to volunteer their PIN. They then send an apparently official courier to collect the card. Financial Fraud Action said people need to protect themselves and their cards. The organisation advises standing close to the cash machine and shielding the keypad when entering a PIN. A spokesman said: ‘If someone is crowding or watching you, cancel the transaction and go to another machine.  Do not accept help from seemingly well-meaning strangers and never allow yourself to be distracted. ‘If your card is retained by the machine for any reason, report it to your card company immediately.’ Scam: Leonid Rotaru avoided jail last December despite being involved in a £3m cash machine fraud . A Romanian man involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £3 million and with 9,000 potential victims walked free from court. Leonid Rotaru helped to fit 'skimming' devices on cash dispensers, which downloaded the card details of those who used them. The scam was relatively sophisticated - and can be contrasted with other cash machine thefts where the thieves surreptitiously read the user's pin before stealing their card. Police investigating Rotaru said they discovered 9,000 different card accounts on a computer they seized. Detectives estimated that the network to which Rotaru belonged had access to at least £3 million, based on the average fraud per card for typical skimming offences. But despite that the fraudster, 32, avoided a jail term when he appeared before Taunton Crown Court last December. He was instead given a 18-month prison sentence which was suspended for two years. Speaking outside the court, Avon and Somerset Police civilian investigator Barrie Douglas said: 'The potential in these cases is always for a lot of money to be made. Banks say the average (fraud) per card is around £460.' Rotaru's role in the scam was to fit the discreet skimming device to a cash machine, which was later removed and used to download the card details relevant to each unwitting victim’s account. Those details were then sent on an email to another man. Rotaru, of Bridgwater, Somerset, told police he was 'at the bottom end' of the operation, and that the 'big boys operated out of London'. He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours community service.\n",
      "259. U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas has sentenced Teresa Giudice to 15 months in federal prison and husband Joe Giudice to 41 months, while also ordering both to individually pay $414,588 in restitution. The couple will also serve two years of probation upon being released, almost the maximum sentence that could have been handed down after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and three types of bankruptcy fraud earlier this year. Teresa broke down in tears before her sentencing saying, 'I am more sorry than anyone will ever know,' adding to the judge, 'I will make this right.' Scroll down for video . Avoiding the press: Teresa Giudice (above, with husband Joe leaving the courtroom) was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison by a judge today, and broke down in tears as she was sentenced . Going away: Joe, who was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $414,588, gripped his wife's hand as they left the courthouse . Family: The Giudices have four daughters, Gia (above in purple), Gabriella (above in orange), Milania (above in blue) and Audriana (above in white) Hiding: The two quickly rushed from the courtroom to their car after being sentenced . 'I need to send a message. In the eyes of the law it doesn't matter who you are. There are consequences to pay,' the judge told Teresa as she handed out her sentence. 'Confinement is absolutely necessary in this case,' Salas added, after admitting she did briefly consider probation for the reality star. 'I don’t honestly believe you respect the law.' Teresa, 42, will report to prison on January 5, while Joe will report to prison after his wife serves her sentence so one of them can be with their four children while the other is away. 'She thumbed her nose at the court, now she wants sympathy,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan W. Romankow told the judge earlier in the day according to Jack Barbosa, who was in the courtroom. Romankow then recommended she receive 21 months in prison for her crimes. Keeping watch: the couple was flanked by security guards as they left the courthouse . Frenzy: The couple were surrounded by media as they took off in their white Mercedes Benz GL450 (above) Joe, 43, also pleaded guilty to failing to file a tax return for 2004, though he acknowledged he didn't file taxes on income of approximately $1 million between 2004 and 2008. He will serve 12 months on that charge, but it will run concurrently with the 41 months he had already received for his other crimes. With good behavior, Teresa could be out in 12 months. Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, said the sentencing was 'fair, appropriate and reasonable.' No special treatment: The attorneys for both were unsuccessful in getting the judge to be lenient on the couple . The look: Her blouse was uncharacteristically conservative, but her eyelashes were their usual camera-ready selves . Under fire: Judge Esther Salas yelled at the couple early in the day for omissions in their financial disclosure forms . The judge said that immigration services will not act on Joe's deportation case until after he serves time. Joe's attorneys have said that he came to the U.S. as an infant from Italy and wasn't aware that he wasn't an American citizen. According to Radar Online, Joe's lawyers have told him he should start preparing to be deported to Italy after he serves time. The judge also recommended that he participate in an alcohol program, this after Joe's lawyer, Miles Feinstein, said Joe had a drinking problem and should be sent to rehab rather than prison. Feinstein even told the judge that Joe shows up to his office 'smelling of booze.' Joe also spent time in court trying to exonerate his wife from these charges, something his lawyer called 'the mark of a real man.' His lawyer then tried to place all blame on his client once his sentence had been handed down, and say Teresa should be kept out of jail for their girls, delaying her sentencing by hours. Large crowd: The couple was surrounded by attorneys and others to get through the crowd as they entered court this morning . Keeping the peace: Barricades were set up to the courthouse steps, leaving a path for the Giudices to enter the courthouse for their 10 am sentencing . Earlier, Judge Salas had yelled at the couple for failing to let the court know they purchased 'recreational vehicles, home furnishings, cars, construction equipment' and more over the past few months. 'How is it that at this point the court is having to go over this?' Salas asked the couple's defense attorneys, according to The Record. The couple apparently had no answer for the judge, claiming they had hired an accountant and provided that person with their financial information. The judge also pointed out the couple had previously hid assets from the court, forcing her to put off their sentencing. 'It's the same pattern of obstruction and dishonesty and manipulation that they showed in the bankruptcy case,' the prosecutor told Judge Salas. The couple also said on forms they only own $25,000 worth of furniture in their $3 million home, saying the production company furnishes the house for them during filming. The judge then asked why, if this was the case, they had a $1 million insurance policy. She also reminded the two that in 2009 bankruptcy filings, the couple showed $60,000 in assets in their home. McMansion: The couple claims they only have $25,000 worth of furniture in their $3 million mansion (above), and that the production crew provides furnishings when they film . Conflicting report: In their 2009 bankruptcy filing however, the Giudices claimed $60,000 worth of furniture in their mansion (above) 'They had an obligation to be transparent and candid and open with the court and I don't think I got that,' Judge Salas said according to NJ.com. 'I want to understand the disconnect.' Teresa also listed her jewelry amount as 0, saying most is costume jewelry and not worth much. According to a reporter from the Star-Ledger in the courtroom, the judge then said that 'the pattern of omissions and inconsistencies does not make the couple seem worthy of leniency.' Joe's lawyer blamed these recent actions on his client's difficulty dealing with the death of his father this past June. 'He hasn't been the same person,' Feinstein said. 'That was his best friend.' Cheap baubles: Teresa filed a 0 for the worth of her jewelry on court documents . Precious gems: A photo of Teresa's hand from an event in September of 2013 seems to show she does have some very nice jewelry . Joe read a letter to the court before he was sentenced, saying, 'I stand here humiliated before the court and my family and society. I disgraced many people, including my wife and four daughters. I take full responsibility for my actions. I promise to be a better person.' The couple took a plea deal in March, admitting that they hid assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitted phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans. The couple also got some bad news earlier this week when a bankruptcy judge denied their claim to erase over $13 million in debt. The couple arrived for the 10 am hearing at little after 9 this morning, Teresa dressing very conservatively in a black suit and yellow oxford shirt. Recent actions: Joe's lawyer blamed his client's financial omissions on his emotional state after losing his father (seen above with Joe's oldest daughter Gia) Reality star: Teresa has been featured on all six seasons of Real Housewives of New Jersey . The good news however is that the couple's daughters, Gia, Gabriella, Milania and Audriana,will not be without a parent as each serves their time. 'My four daughters are my life. I don't care about the TV show,' Teresa had told the judge in court today. Neither Teresa, Joe or their attorneys have commented yet on today's events. A spokeswoman for NBCUniversal, which owns Bravo, the channel that airs Real Housewives, said that the network wasn't commenting on the Giudices' position with the show.\n",
      "260. Champion lover: Sonko Tijan was arrested by Austrian police who found he had no less than four wives, seven fiancées and five girlfriends . A prolific lover with four wives, seven fiancées and five girlfriends has set Austria's record for bigamy. Sonko Tijan was finally caught in a honey trap at Vienna Airport after two of his wives realised they were married to the same man and complained to police. The seducer had picked up women all across the country, using them for room and board whenever he was nearby and borrowing money from them which he never returned. His downfall came after he met Sonja Maier, who believed she had found love at first sight when she was swept off her feet by Tijan after meeting him in a bar. The 28-year-old from Gambia told her he felt the same, and after a whirlwind romance - and against the advice of her family - they were married a month later. After a year of happy marriage she was pregnant and browsing Facebook when she happened across somebody with the same surname and a strikingly similar-looking husband. Curious, the delved into the woman's profile. Then she realised this woman's husband was not only similar looking, but actually identical. The fact he had the same surname as her own spouse convinced her something was wrong. 'I thought that either he had a twin I never knew about or he was cheating on me,' she said. Ms Maier got in touch with the woman to compare notes. Soon they realised that when he was with one of them, he was never with the other, and together they made a complaint to police after he vanished when they confronted him. That complaint led to the unravelling of a web of intrigue that has so far revealed 16 different women all of whom believed they were in an exclusive relationship with Tijan, including three who were married to him. The youngest of his women was 22, and the oldest 44; there is also another woman he is married to in his home country, where he also has children. Tijan used the women to provide him with a place to stay and food whenever he was in the area, and also borrowed tens of thousands of euros promising to pay it back later. He never did. Some also complained he had taken their jewellery to use as a security on loans he needed. And if a woman became too demanding on his time or for her money back, she suddenly found that he had vanished. Living by his looks: Tijan used the women to provide him with a place to stay and food whenever he was in the area, and also borrowed tens of thousands of euros promising to pay it back later. He never did . Police have now found that he kept a network of women across Austria from the western state of Vorarleberg to the capital Vienna. As well as the 15 active lovers, they believe there were many others who he used, then dumped. Winning smile: Police have also found four children Tijan has fathered with different women in Austria. Two of his current girlfriends were also pregnant . Police have also found four children Tijan has fathered with different women in Austra. Two of his current girlfriends were pregnant. Detective Patrick Maierhofer, who has made an appeal for other women to come forward, said: 'He always used the same tactics. He would look at women in bars and was always charming and attentive. 'He would also fascinate them with fanciful stories about his homeland in Africa and how he had fled horrific wars leaving his family behind - and later he would ask for financial assistance for them.' Tijan has also been accused of benefits fraud, using his women, children and fake names and photos of friends who were also black to claim thousands from the Austrian social services. He once posted online that the Austrians could not tell the difference between black men anyway. Vienna police spokesman Thomas Keiblinger said: 'He went under various names and we have released his picture at some of his names in the hope that we can contact other victims. 'They included the names Sonko Tijan, Bojang Tijan and Crang Junior. 'He claimed the money was for business ventures to help his family in Gambia. We have found that he is actually also married to a woman in Gambia where he also has a family.' Police put out an arrest warrant for him and eventually tracked him down using Facebook after discovering he was on the hunt for fresh victims. Officers arranged for a honey trap with the cooperation of a young woman he had been communicating with online to persuade her to lend him more money. In reality though she was working with police and he was arrested.\n",
      "261. Matthew Ames, who conned people out of their life savings and pensions using a fake conservation company, has been jailed for 40 months . A ‘green finance’ boss who hired the brother of the Duchess of Cambridge to promote a bogus rainforest protection scheme was jailed today. Matthew Ames, 38, cheated ethical investors out of £1.6m through fake green projects to fund his luxury lifestyle, including buying a Lamborghini sports car, Isleworth Crown Court heard. His business Forestry For Life, which netted over £400,000 by claiming to protect the Amazon rainforest, was represented by Kate Middleton’s brother James at a trade fair in London in 2010. Ames also hired England World Cup winner Jack Charlton and sport supremo Sir Rodney Walker to promote Forestry for Life and his other firm, the Investor Club, at events. The company director used glossy brochures including quotes from Prince Charles and Tony Blair to promote teak plantation schemes in Sri Lanka and investment in the protection of the Brazilian rainforest. But no land was ever purchased by Ames’ two companies and not a single tree was ever planted. He even swindled an elderly investor out of £75,000 for a fake tree scheme after claiming the teak market was outstripping that of gold and oil. Ames blew the cash on sports cars, flying first class around the world and staying in luxury villas in the Caribbean. A jury of six men and six women at Isleworth Crown Court found Ames guilty of two counts of fraudulent trading by majority verdict. Today, Judge Paul Dugdale sentenced the con-artist to 40 months imprisonment, saying: ‘You raised money from a number of members of the public, generally speaking those who had savings to invest. ‘They tended to be older but by definition people who have a lump sum to invest tend to be older. ‘What you did was put their savings at risk for your ends, when you had told them what you were going to do with their money. ‘You defrauded them. You told them they would get an immediate 12 per cent return when this was never achievable. ‘I find, from all of the evidence, that you knew it was never achievable and that the representation was simply not true. ‘Some of the money you received was also misused. It was used by you to borrow from the company to purchase an expensive Lamborghini sports car. Life of luxury: While investors were promised instant returns for their money, Ames was actually spending the funds on flashy items such as a Lamborghini sports car . ‘Many investors lost all of their life savings, many of the investors lost all the money they had invested in their pensions. ‘It is noteworthy that you did visit all of the investors that lost their money. ‘It is something that is to your credit but it remains the fact that the reason they lost the money was due to your fraud. ‘The sentence I would have passed was in the region of five years. I reduce that sentence to 40 months, that is concurrent on both counts.’ Ames, wearing a blue suit and carrying two large overnight bags in preparation for prison, remained emotionless as the sentence was passed. His mother and other family members watched on from the public gallery. Prosecutor Antony Swift pressed for a longer sentence, of four to five years, revealing the defendant is already the subject of a 13-year company directorship ban, imposed in 2013. But defence counsel Adam Budworth argued: ‘This was not a case when the defendant set out with a ‘boiler room’ as it were, with high-pressure sales techniques. ‘2009 to 2010 were desperate times for investors. I hope your honour won’t make Mr Ames a scapegoat of failings in the regulatory system that existed at the time. Mathew Ames (left) used celebrities, including footballer Jack Charlton (right) to lend himself credibility . ‘In short, my submission to your honour is that Mr Ames is not a bad man. He is a good man. ‘The sentence I am seeking from your honour is an exceptional sentence and - I know I have a high and vertiginous slope to climb - that is that your honour suspend this sentence [and] give him a very significant period of unpaid work. ‘He has four children and he is in the process of getting divorced.’ The barrister argued that his client should be allowed to continue work so he could repay his investors quickly. ‘He is able to return to work and earn £10,000 a month. ‘My submission is that the impact of sending this man to prison is to let him off lightly.’ Ames secured a total of over £1.1m in investments into the Investor Club following its launch in August 2008. Forestry For Life, set up in July 2009, took £400,000 from green investors by purporting to protect the Amazon Rainforest. James Middleton was photographed representing the green firm at a carbon trading exhibition in London in October 2010 - while Ames was under investigation by the Financial Services Authority. Mr Middleton had briefly worked with Ames for work experience after becoming involved in the development of Forestry For Life in June 2010. The company would offer investors carbon credits that would be used to plant trees and offset their carbon footprint, the court heard. But Forestry For Life was offering credits for rainforest it did not own and the firm rarely gave investors certificates or proof of purchase. Ames also offered punters high return rates of 15 percent a year on their original investment but returns were often late and not paid in full. Ames, who lived in this gated house in Thundersley, Essex, convinced one donor to hand over £75,000 of their savings after convincing them that the teak wood market was outperforming gold and oil . The jury heard that Ames used a Ponzi scheme to cover up the fraud by repaying first investors with new investors’ money. The company director was finally caught out following an undercover sting by the Basildon Echo in August 2010 in which a reporter was mis-sold carbon credits. The article led to the FSA investigating Ames’ firms - both run from a converted barn in Laindon, Essex. Both Forestry For Life and Investor Club were placed into liquidation in March 2011 with combined debts of more than £1.6m. Ames, the son of David Ames, 62, the boss of Caribbean property developer Harlequin Ames, was arrested in September 2011 following a referral from the FSA to City of London Police’s specialist fraud unit. Ames attempted to cover his tracks using a Ponzi scheme, repaying initial backers with money from new investors . Giving evidence Matthew Ames claimed he was ‘this close’ to selling his business to Barclays Bank before he was shut down by the authorities. The green finance boss told jurors that he was not able to plant 5,000 tree saplings in Sri Lanka because he could not secure the ‘right’ land. He also claimed that every penny of the tens of thousands of pounds that he invoiced his firms for on business expenses were ‘perfectly legitimate’. Ames spent investors’ cash on meals at the exclusive Ivy in the West End and at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, alongside stays at the Savoy, the Hilton, and the Mandarin Oriental - a five-star hotel in Hong Kong. He also invoiced Forestry For Life and the Investor Club for a stay at the Upper House in Hong Kong and tickets to a Manchester United game at Old Trafford. Jurors also heard of Ames’ boasts to potential ethical investors. In one April 2010 email he wrote: ‘You just caught me coming out of a Lamborghini after ordering my new one. ‘Had a meeting with you the other day and had much to discuss. ‘I’m opening a new office in Dubai alongside ones in Singapore, Dublin, and London and have travelled between India, Singapore, and London’. Harlequin has allegedly taken an estimated £300m from investors for 6,000 off plan hotel rooms and villas since 2005, but so far built just 300. The UK sales section of Harlequin went bust in April last year after several investors requested their money back. Ames, of Thundersley, Essex, denied but was convicted of two counts of fraudulent trading. A confiscation hearing will be held on 21 October at Isleworth Crown Court.\n",
      "262. Guilty: Thomas Dunkley has been found guilty of murdering ex-WBA light-middleweight boxer Shaun Cummins . A carer who murdered a former boxing champion and dismembered his body with a chainsaw before storing the parts in freezers at his home, was today sentenced to life in prison. Thomas Dunkley, 29, killed Shaun Cummins, 45, before stealing more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight and storing his body parts in freezers at his bungalow. Mr Cummins who was nicknamed ‘The Guvnor’ had received a £400,000 payout in 2004 following a road accident that left him paralysed from the waist down. Leicester Crown Court heard . debt-ridden Dunkley had given up his job to look after Mr Cummins - but, . after two years, still hadn’t received a penny in return. Jurors were told he spent over . £10,000 of Mr Cummins’ cash after the killing ‘without a care in the . world’, splashing out on a new car and clothes. He also transferred £15,000 from a trust fund set up for the former sportsman. But Dunkley was arrested when a . suspicious nurse who used to visit Mr Cummins at his home told police . she hadn’t seen him for days - and officers forced their way in before . making the grim discovery. Mr Cummins’ body had been cut into . ten pieces and wrapped in binliners sealed with duct tape, then stored . in three separate freezers - one of which Dunkley had bought . specifically for the task. The court heard that when interviewed . by detectives, he claimed Mr Cummins had died of natural causes and . admitted cutting up his body - but said he could not explain why. Dunkley was told he must serve a least 34 years before he can apply for parole. Judge Mrs Justice Dobbs told him: 'In . my judgement this was a murder for gain. The dismemberment of the body . was a grotesque act, violating Mr Cummins as a person, and his dignity . in death.' Scroll down for video . Death: Thomas Dunkley, 29, allegedly murdered Shaun Cummins, . 45, then stole more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight . boxer and stored his body parts at his bungalow . Gruesome: The dismembered body of Shaun Cummin was found by police at his home in Saffron Lance, Leicestershire . The court heard that because of the dismemberment, it was impossible to say how he had died. Dunkley, of no fixed address, denied murder but admitted preventing a lawful burial by cutting Mr Cummins’ body up. He has also pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud, relating to accessing Mr Cummins’ funds after his death. Mr Cummins, who also worked as a . bodyguard for the boyband Blue before his accident, retired from boxing . in 1995 with a record of 22 wins, six defeats and a draw. He became the Inter-continental Light . Middleweight champion in 1992 by defeating Steve Foster, then . successfully defended his title a year later against Mickey Hughes. William Harbage QC, prosecuting, said Dunkley, 29, and Mr Cummins met in 2007 through a mutual friend who ran a boxing club. He told the hearing that initially, Dunkley was simply ‘someone for MrCummins to play computer games with’. Former boxer: Shaun Cummins (right) on the attack against Tony Velinor (left) 23 years ago in January 1990 . But Mr Harbage added: 'In the last . two years of his life, Thomas Dunkley effectively became his full-time . carer. By August 2012, he was a continuous presence at his home.' The court heard Mr Cummins, who was virtually bed-ridden, received daily visits from community nurses. But Mr Harbage said Dunkley was . constantly on standby with to change the bedsheets, take delivery of . medication, and run other errands. He was also trusted to deal with . financial transactions, as well as the handling of blank cheques from a . trust fund set up after Mr Cummins’ accident. It still held a balance of . £44,000 at the time of his death. Flowers in tribute: Police made the gruesome find on September 12 last year after concerned nurses who cared for the paraplegic contacted the police . Mr Harbage told the jury: “It appears no payment was made to Thomas Dunkley for his time. 'He owed £16,500 to creditors, and at . the time, his personal debts were increasing. It appears he had been . hoping there would be some financial recompense, either through a direct . payment or a share in the profits of a business venture Mr Cummins had . embarked on.” However, Mr Harbage said it was . accepted Mr Cummins could be ‘strong-willed and overbearing’, and ‘took . advantage’ of Dunkley, who felt ‘bullied’. The court heard that in the days . before the alleged killing, Dunkley told a mutual friend that he ‘had . had enough of Mr Cummins and was getting away from him because he had . wrecked his life over the past couple of years.’ He said: “In this case, we point to . the background of bullying, the attraction of the defendant in helping . himself to the remaining financial resources of Mr Cummins, and the . desire to break free from the man who had made his life a misery. 'It may be any one of these motives or a combination that caused Thomas Dunkley to act as he did.' Mr Harbage said that apart from . Dunkley, the last person to see Mr Cummins alive was a community nurse . on September 1 last year. He added that it was impossible to . say when he died - but it was ‘most likely’ to have been either later . that day, or the following day. The jury heard that on September 1, . Dunkley carried out a number of internet searches including ‘what . happens when you are stabbed in the stomach’, ‘how long does it take to . die after being stabbed’, and ‘what is the fastest way for a human to bleed to death’. And 24 hours later, Mr Harbage said . he ‘intercepted’ community nurses outside the bungalow, falsely telling . them Mr Cummins had been admitted to hospital. The court heard that by September 4, . Dunkley began using Mr Cummins’ bank accounts. In total, he either spent . or withdrew a total of £10,819. It was claimed that by September 6, . Dunkley had decided to cut up Mr Cummins’ body, which had started to . decompose, and store it in freezers ‘while he worked out what to do’. Mr Harbage said he bought a chainsaw . and incinerator, as well as overalls, dust sheets, binliners, duct tape, . a face mask and goggles. Investigation: Dunkley allegedly dismembered the body after killing Mr Cummins and placed the parts in bin bags before sealing them with duct tape and putting them in the freezer at his home in Leicester (pictured) The prosecutor added that neighbours . saw smoke and noticed a ‘horrible smell’ in the air as Dunkley burned . items in the back garden. He also bought a chest freezer as the . two already in the house weren’t big enough to store Mr Cummins’ body - . a fact he later admitted to the police. Jurors were told Dunkley was then . seen over the next few days by a several witnesses ‘without a care in . the world’ as he shopped for clothes. But by September 12 a community nurse . realised she hadn’t seen Mr Cummins for days - and, after quizzing . Dunkley about his whereabouts, alerted the police. Mr Harbage said Dunkley watched from a parked car as officers arrived to search the bungalow - then ‘fled’ Leicester. He was arrested at Wooley Edge services on the M1 near Wakefield in Yorkshire the next day. Dunkley denied murder between September 1 and 9 last year. He was also convicted of using Mr Cummins credit card and taking out a payday loan in his name in the months before his death. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
      "263. A man who spent almost $35,000 trying to learn some of Donald Trump's real estate secrets claimed he left the sessions with little more than a photo of him next to a life-sized cardboard cut out of Trump to show for his investment. Bob Guillo, of Long Island, said: 'They . told everybody to get their credit card limits raised to buy real . estate, but the true purpose was to pay $35,000 for the next bunch of . seminars.' Another entrepreneur hoping to learn the secrets of the trade was Nora Hanna, who said she paid $17,000 for the Trump University program, before concluding 'what I learned there, I could read on the internet'. Disappointed: Bob Guillo with a cardboard cut out of Trump, taken at one of the seminars . It took the Brooklyn woman two months to get her money back, as promised to those who changed their mind within three days. 'They wouldn't answer my calls or emails,' she said, adding that eventually the money was returned. Trump's former students have been coming forward to tell their stories in the wake of a $40 million lawsuit against The Apprentice star and his real estate school by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Mr Schneiderman claims Trump helped run a phony university that promised to make students rich but instead steered them into expensive and largely useless seminars. The billionaire developer said Schneiderman's lawsuit was false and that his school had done a 'fantastic job', with a 98 per cent approval rating among students from around the country. He called the attorney general 'a political hack looking to get publicity'. Mr Guillo said during group seminars he attended in New York hotel conference rooms in 2009 and early 2010, an instructor 'was flashing his Rolex watch and wearing a very expensive suit and fancy cufflinks as he told us his rags-to-riches story'. 'We followed PowerPoint presentations, and they gave us loose-leaf manuals and websites you could pull up on your home computer. We were all scammed,' Mr Guillo claimed. Beleaguered: Donald Trump, pictured with his university emblem in May 2005, has been sued for $40 million after a lawsuit claims the classes were mostly useless and failed to live up to their promises . However, not everyone feels that way, with another former student calling her experience 'extremely positive'. 'It was an education that opened the door for us in real estate,' Marla Rains-Colic said. Ms . Rains-Colic and her husband paid $25,000 for a private three-day . mentorship progam in St Louis with a real estate expert chosen by . Trump's organization. Michael . Greco is another student who has called the lawsuit baseless. After a . free introductory presentation, the New Jersey resident spent $500 for . an online tutorial offered by Trump. 'I . got my value, and it was real value,' Mr Greco said, adding that he . never felt pressured to pay or do any more than that. 'I got my money's . worth,' he added. Complaint: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman brought the suit against Trump . According . to the lawsuit, some students in the initial three-day group seminar . costing $1,495 were upset that they were pressured to take more . expensive Trump 'Elite' programs. When . Associated Press asked for names of students who testified for the . lawsuit, Mr Schneiderman's office provided only two - Mr Guillo's and Mr . Hanna's. Another student claiming the program failed to fulfill its promise of insider expertise is Sema Tekinay. She . said she paid $10,000 in 2009 and was supposed to get three . instructor-led courses in New York or New Jersey, with access to . advisers to guide her to private lenders and foreclosed properties. Instead, she said, she was told the courses would be offered in Texas and California - and then, only online. She tried to cancel but was told she could not because three days had already passed. 'I felt fooled,' she said. Another . student, Gregory Ryan, has sued Trump University separately in state . court on Long Island, saying he was the victim of a $25,000 'rip-off'. A . class-action lawsuit was also filed against Trump University in a San . Diego court by Tarla Makaeff, on behalf of students nationwide, claiming . she was scammed out of nearly $40,000 while attending seminars in 2008. Mr Scheiderman filed the suit on Saturday, and Trump immediately shot back that it was false and politically motivated. Mr Schneiderman . claimed many of the 5,000 students who paid up to $35,000 thought they . would at least meet Trump but instead all they got was their picture . taken in front of a life-size picture of him. 'Trump . University engaged in deception at every stage of consumers' advancement through costly programs and caused real financial harm,' Schneiderman said. 'Trump . University, with Donald Trump's knowledge and participation, relied on . Trump's name recognition and celebrity status to take advantage of . consumers who believed in the Trump brand.' State Education Department officials told Trump to change the name of his enterprise years ago, saying it . lacked a license and didn't meet the legal definitions of a university. In 2011 it was renamed the 'Trump Entrepreneur Institute', but it has since been . dogged by complaints from consumers and a few civil . lawsuits claiming it didn't fulfill its advertised claims. Mr Schneiderman's . lawsuit covers complaints dating to 2005 through 2011 and it claims that students paid . between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn from the mogul. He said the . three-day seminars failed to teach consumers everything they . needed to know about real estate, as the 'university' had promised. The Trump University manual tells . instructors not to let consumers 'think three days will be enough to . make them successful', Mr Schneiderman said. Angered: Trump accused the attorney general of being politically motivated with his lawsuit and said it was a way for Schneiderman to try to extort campaign contributions from him . At the seminars, . consumers were told about 'Trump Elite' mentorships that cost $10,000 to . $35,000 in which students were promised individual instruction until they made . their first deal. Mr Schneiderman said participants were urged to extend . the limit on their credit cards for real estate deals, but then used the . credit to pay for the Trump Elite programs. The attorney general said . the program also failed to promptly cancel memberships as promised. The lawsuit added that many of students were unable to land even one real estate deal and were left far . worse off than before the lessons, facing thousands of dollars in debt. But . Trump's attorney accused Mr Schneiderman of trying to extort campaign . contributions from the real estate mogul through his investigation. Attorney . Michael D. Cohen told The Associated Press on Saturday that . Schneiderman's lawsuit was filled with falsehoods. Mr Cohen insisted . that Trump and his university never defrauded anyone. 'The attorney general has been angry . because he felt that Mr Trump and his various companies should have . done much more for him in terms of fundraising,' Mr Cohen said. 'This . entire investigation is politically motivated and it is a tremendous . waste of taxpayers' money.' State Board of Elections records show Trump has spent more than $136,000 on New York campaigns since 2010. He contributed $12,500 to Mr Schneiderman in October 2010, when Mr Schneiderman was running for attorney general, records show. An outspoken conservative, Trump himself flirted with a presidential run last year. 'Donald Trump will not sit back and be extorted by anyone, including the attorney general,' Mr Cohen said. Mr Schneiderman is suing the program, Trump as the university chairman, and the former president of the university in a case to be handled in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. He accuses them of engaging in persistent fraud, illegal and deceptive conduct and violating federal consumer protection law. The $40 million he seeks is mostly to pay restitution to consumers. He dismissed Trump's claim of a political motive. 'The fact that he's still brave enough to follow the investigation wherever it may lead speaks to Mr Schneiderman's character,' Mr Schneiderman spokesman Andrew Friedman told AP.\n",
      "264. Kelly Billen was branded a 'manipulative deviant' after she ransacked the home of her  neighbour, 94, and stole £20,000 worth of his premium bonds . A woman spent four days ransacking the home of her elderly neighbour, ripping up floorboards to steal his valuables and eventually cashing in his life savings of almost £20,000. Kelly Billen, 35, devastated the home of 94-year-old Richard Jones near Aberdare in south Wales, overturning furniture and lifting attic insulation to find anything she could possibly steal. The pensioner had been away for just four days when his niece went to check on the house and found all the rooms had been searched, furniture overturned and the house plundered. It emerged Billen had raided the house, eventually finding paperwork for Mr Jones' life savings in premium bonds for £19,426 which she managed to cash in. However she was caught after she left a footprint at the scene, traced back to one of her trainers. Police have branded Billen, who used to work in a care home, a 'manipulative deviant.' Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mr Jones’s niece visited his home to check on the property and left in “disbelief because there was such a mess”. Mr Jones has dementia and is now living in a care home, unaware of what happened at his home. Ian Kolvin, prosecuting Billen, said: 'The house was ransacked. All the rooms had been searched. 'All the property had been turned upside down and even the insulation in the attic had been pulled up.' However Billen was tracked down after she left a footprint at the scene in Hirwaun and was identified by tests on her Nike trainer. Mr Jones's financial documents were found in her shed. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard she tried to register for online banking at Nationwide and the Principality building society to access his accounts. She also tried to cash a £1,100 cheque at Lloyds but was turned away. Lucy Crowther, defending, said Billen had been a care worker but had increasing debts after turning to amphetamines. At a hearing at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court Billen was jailed for three years and three months for burglary . Billen was jailed for three years and three months after admitting burglary and eight counts of fraud. Recorder Richard Booth QC said: 'When you got hold of the documents you got busy with a view of obtaining money for drugs.' Detective Constable Gareth Millard later said: 'This was a callous and calculated crime which could very easily have drained this innocent, vulnerable man of his life savings. 'She deserves her time in prison and for people to know exactly what a manipulative deviant she is.'\n",
      "265. With his wealth, glamorous lifestyle and friends in high places, Jonathan Price probably seemed too good to be true. Unfortunately for the women who fell for his charms, that’s exactly  what he was. The serial conman posed as a rich ‘sugar daddy’ to trap a string of professional women and fleece them for tens of thousands of pounds. The penniless 41-year-old told his targets he was a multi-millionaire and even bragged of being friends with billionaire Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. 'Callous' behaviour: Jonathan Price (left and right) told his unsuspecting victims he was a multi-millionaire with offshore accounts and was suffering from terminal cancer, Teesside Crown Court was told . He also claimed to have served in the SAS and the Parachute Regiment and boasted of owning speedboats, luxury cars and overseas property. He used a dating website called sugardaddies.com to meet women, who were taken in by his apparently glamorous lifestyle and became his girlfriends. He now faces jail after pleading guilty to fraud totalling £180,000 – leaving three women and their parents without their life savings. Price, from Darlington, told his unsuspecting targets that he had vast sums of money in offshore accounts and was suffering from terminal cancer. The conman then wined and dined each girlfriend using the cash he got from his other victims. He even proposed to one, booking a £96,000 wedding at an exclusive hotel. Online: The conman met a string of women on sugardaddies.com (homepage pictured) then tricked them into parting with tens of thousands of pounds . So convincing was he that his victims persuaded their elderly parents to help him out when he claimed to have encountered cash flow problems, believing he was more than capable of paying back their loans. Teesside Crown Court heard that Price was really a penniless ‘serial’ fraudster who left a trail of victims traumatised and facing financial ruin. He has served four prison sentences and collected seven previous convictions for dishonesty from across the UK over the past two decades. Legal documents describe him as  ‘callous’ and say ‘deception is so deeply ingrained in his mind’ that he was planning his next con while still in jail for the last. Judge Michael Taylor said during the hearing: ‘He is as dishonest as the day is long. He is a conman first and foremost. ‘If he is hoping to pull the  wool over my eyes, he’s in the wrong courtroom.’ Victim: Davina Ward, left, who was told that Price, right, had a fortune in offshore accounts . Price’s barrister, Peter Sabiston, added: ‘He is unsure because of the lies he has told what is true and what is fantasy. He does seem to lead a life of fantasy.’ When online, Price pretended to be looking for the love of his life and ironically wrote that he needed a woman who was ‘honest and trustworthy’. His victims included Davina Ward, 32, who runs a florist business in Bournemouth, and Sarah Giles, 39, who worked as a manager at a gun retailer in London. His third victim, a high-flying executive in her 30s who cannot be named, became his wife and was pregnant with his child when he was arrested last May. Price produced fake bank account paperwork to convince his victims he had fortunes tucked away, providing sham security for loans he would ask them for. Each time his web of deceit appeared to be unravelling, he would disappear, claiming to be unwell or saying he had been involved in an accident. On one occasion after going missing, he posed as an old army mate and sent emails to one of the women saying Price was gravely ill with a brain tumour. 'Acquaintances': Jonathan Price boasted of being a friend of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky (pictured), an exiled critic of president Vladmir Putin, who was found dead last weekend . Abroad: One woman was spun what came to be a familiar yarn that Price was obscenely wealthy with funds in an offshore account in the Cayman Islands (file picture), but did not have long to live . Luxury living: While in the capital, Price was seeing a woman, having lunch in Harrods (pictured) in Knightsbridge, central London, and telling her tall tales about his vast wealth . During his three-year campaign of deceit, he claimed to live in Sandbanks in Dorset, which contains some of the most expensive houses in Britain, and made an offer on a £5million property. He also boasted of being a friend of Boris Berezovsky, the exiled critic of president Vladmir Putin. Mr Berezovsky was found dead at the weekend. Price extracted money from his girlfriends and their families by claiming to be having trouble freeing some of his fortune from overseas accounts. When he met Miss Ward in 2007, he claimed to have funds in an offshore account in the Cayman Islands, but said he did not have long to live. He claimed he was using money from Miss Ward and her parents for trips to London for medical treatment. On wheels: Price ran up huge debts on a woman's credit cards - hiring a Land Rover Discovery (file picture) and driving it to Monaco, and asking his lover to fly out to see him . The sugardaddies.com website used by Jonathan Price is just one of a growing number of novelty internet dating agencies. It aims to attract young women in search of a wealthy older man, promising: ‘You are one step away from finding your dream Sugar Daddy.’ It targets ‘aspiring models, actresses and businesswomen’ who are ‘struggling in the early part of their career’. The blurb reads: ‘Would you like to have a man be a provider for you? Do you just love to be taken care of and treated like a princess?’ It promises to connect these hopeful women to men who have ‘attained substantial success’ and are willing to ‘share the finer things in life’. Men and women signing up are asked to give only their email address and personal details such as height and hobbies. But as with other dating websites, there is little way of checking that people really are who they say they are. But while in the capital, he was seeing Miss Giles, having lunch in Harrods and telling her the same tall tales about his vast wealth. After ending his relationship with Miss Ward, he continued to see Miss Giles, racking up huge debts on her credit cards. He even hired a Land Rover Discovery and drove it to Monaco, asking his lover to fly out to see him. She declared herself bankrupt and was living like a pauper when he began seeing the third woman, who he then proposed to. He went shopping on Bond Street for an engagement ring and booked a £96,000 wedding at the exclusive Rockliffe Hall, near Darlington. In the end, he cancelled the couple’s extravagant wedding, leading his fiancee to believe it was because of his ill health, and they were married at Harrogate Register Office with just four guests. Again, Price began to ‘borrow’ money from the woman and her family, but was arrested when her parents became suspicious. He now awaits sentence for the fraud, the victims of which also included estate agents, car and boat dealers and a businessman.\n",
      "266. Former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and his family broke down in tears Thursday as a jury read its decision that he and his wife did sell the influence of the office to a wealthy vitamin executive seeking legitimacy for his company's signature product. 'Gut wrenching sobs' rang out in the courtroom as verdicts on the 13 counts, most of them guilty, were read to the courtroom. As the once popular governor was found guilty on 11 counts, he wept with his face buried in his hands. His wife was found guilt on nine counts. Three of the couples' five children were also among those family members breaking down in the Richmond courtroom as they held hands and sobbed along with the chorus of guilty verdicts. After the fall: Jurors on Thursday decided former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and his wife did sell the influence of the office to a wealthy vitamin executive. McDonnell is seen here with his son, getting into a car just after he was found guilty . 'My trust remains in the Lord': The ex-governor, who claimed during the trial to have moved in with a priest,  gave reporters very little to the reporters who were mobbed outside the courtroom at the trial's conclusion . Peddling influence: Maureen McDonnell (seen here after the verdicts were read) was found guilty on nine charges on Thursday relating her and her husband's relationship with a vitamin company executive . The torrent of emotions in the courtroom even left two of the jurors, who'd just helped all but guarantee the once-proud governor and his wife will see prison time, in tears themselves. According to NBC News, the governor and his wife will face sentencing January 6. Once considered one of America's most popular governors and even vetted to be running mate to Mitt Romney in 2012, McDonnell now faces as much as 25 years in prison. The man with the money: Jonnie Wiliams bought the McDonnells lavish gifts in exchange for favors and then got himself off the legal hook by testifying against them with immunity . The couple left the courtroom separately and remained apart. Bob McDonnell left first and walked into a witness waiting room. A loudly weeping Maureen McDonnell came out later, hugging one of her daughters. She went into a separate waiting room. 'My trust remains in the Lord,' was about all the ex-governor told reporters who were mobbed outside the courtroom at the conclusion of the marathon trial. Religion had become a theme during the proceedings for Mr. McDonnell, who claimed that his marriage with Maureen had crumbled and he'd moved in with a priest. Attorney's for McDonnell vowed to appeal. 'This is a difficult and disappointing day for the commonwealth and its citizens. Public service frequently requires sacrifice and almost always requires financial sacrifice,' said Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. The jurors all declined to speak to reporters as they left the courthouse through a back door. 'I just want to go home,' said one unidentified juror. CEO Jonnie Williams, the prosecution's star witness, testified under immunity that he spent lavishly on the McDonnells only to secure their help promoting and obtaining state-backed research for Star's tobacco-derived anti-inflammatory, Anatabloc. Bob McDonnell testified he did nothing other than extend routine political courtesies to Williams. Maureen McDonnell did not testify. Williams' immunity deal bars his prosecution not only for his dealings with the McDonnells, but also for possible securities fraud violations that were investigated by a separate grand jury. McDonnell's attorney, Henry Asbill, said in closing arguments Friday that the unusually generous immunity deal was Williams' 'greatest con.' Prosecutor Michael Dry countered that because of the agreement, Williams had no reason to lie on the witness stand. Could have had it all: Once-popular McDonnell had the opportunity to plead guilty to just a single charge, which he passed up and was subsequently tried on 13 charges. On Thursday he was found guilty of all but two . Zoo: McDonnell was once one of the most beloved governors in America and his popularity helped to turn the trial into an all-out media spectacle as viewers clamored to know more about the fallen politician's shady dealings . Emotional: The McDonnell children, including daughter Rachel at right, were among the family members in tears as a chorus of guilty verdicts were read Thursday in a Richmond courtroom . Spencer told the jury that the testimony of a witness who is granted immunity must be more closely examined than testimony of other witnesses. The heightened scrutiny is required to determine whether the testimony of the immunized witness is 'affected by self-interest,' he said. The judge also walked the jury through the charges, including 'honest services fraud' and conspiracy to commit such an offense. He also said a corrupt agreement need not be stated explicitly by the conspirators and that it doesn't matter whether the defendant would have done favors absent a bribe. Spencer also told jurors — who heard from three character witnesses, two for Bob McDonnell and one for his wife — that 'evidence of good character alone may create a reasonable doubt as to a defendant's guilt.' The defense argued that the McDonnells' marriage was in such shambles that the couple could not have conspired because they were barely speaking. Maureen McDonnell's attorney said the first lady developed a 'crush' on Williams, who capitalized on her vulnerability and further poisoned her marriage. The McDonnells attended several events promoting Anatabloc and hosted an event at the governor's mansion that Star billed as a product launch. The former governor also arranged meetings for Williams with administration officials, although none resulted in action. The defense argued that the McDonnells' marriage was in such shambles that the couple could not have conspired because they were barely speaking. Maureen McDonnell's attorney said the first lady developed a 'crush' on Williams, who capitalized on her vulnerability and further poisoned her marriage . Worth it? Among Williams' gifts to the family was a nearly $20,000 New York City shopping spree of designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell . Going for a spin: Williams told prosecutors that he lent the McDonnells his Ferrari, among other favors . Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams testified under immunity that he spent freely on the McDonnells in order to secure their help promoting his supposed cure-all, the tobacco-derived anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. Among the gifts were: . Nearly $20,000 in designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell . A $6,500 Rolex watch for her husband . $15,000 in catering for one of their daughter's wedding . Free vacations . Free golf outings . Free spins in Williams' Ferrari . Williams also provided three loans totaling $120,000 . Infamous watch: Prosecutors determined that Williams gave McDonnell a $6,500 Rolex (pictured) that he was pictured wearing in media interviews that would later come back to haunt him . In addition to lending the McDonnells his Ferrari (pictured with the former governor behind the wheel) Williams also provided three loans totaling $120,000 .\n",
      "267. Former JJB Sports chief executive Christopher Ronnie, 52, was jailed for four years at London's Southwark Crown Court today for pocketing £1 million in a 'very greedy fraud'. Ronnie, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, was found guilty of fraud last month over three six-figure cash payments from companies who were doing business with the sportswear giant while he was in charge in 2007 and 2008. Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told London's Southwark Crown Court: 'This was a flagrant and disgraceful breach of your duty as a CEO of a public limited company.' Former chief executive of JJB Sports Christopher Ronnie, 52, (pictured) has been jailed for four years after accepting more than £1 million in backhanders from suppliers while he was in charge in 2007 and 2008 . Ronnie was £11 million in debt to an Icelandic bank when he took money from two suppliers to the sportswear giant. The Scottish tycoon used some of the cash to splash out on property in Florida in America. But when the troubled Icelandic bank tried to recover its cash, Ronnie lied about his assets and liabilities, Southwark Crown Court in London heard. The charismatic businessman was found guilty last month of fraud over three six-figure cash payments when he was at the helm of JJB Sports in 2008. The judge added: 'Within months you were grossly abusing that position by embarking upon a course of conduct which was dishonest in the extreme. 'Over a period of nine months they gave you just under £1million. 'You hid the fact they had paid you those sums because you wanted to keep your position as CEO and keep the money, and spend it as you did, mainly on the house. 'You had to disguise the real reason for the receipt of that money, you went to great lengths to do so.' The judge said Ronnie had tried to bat off the allegations, telling police it was part of a 'witch-hunt' against him. A JJB Sports closing down sale in Ealing Broadway shopping arcade - Christopher Ronnie has been found guilty of fraud for receiving undisclosed payments while he was chief executive of the company . The judge added: 'I'm unable to see any sign of remorse or even embarrassment about what you have done. 'This was a flagrant and disgraceful breach of your duty as a CEO of a public limited company. 'This was a particularly vulnerable period in the company's history prior to its collapse.' Business partners David Ball and David Barrington - who worked for the firms which made the loans - were sentenced to 18 months in prison each for helping Ronnie cover his tracks. All three must serve at least half their sentence. The suited trio all looked relaxed and stared straight ahead with passive expressions as the sentences were read out. The case against the three men cost the British taxpayer £630,000 - £500,000 on Ronnie's case alone. The fraud focused on three large loans of several hundred thousand pounds which he received from suppliers, but failed to declare to the JJB board. Ronnie, who lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and was chief executive of JJB Sports between August 2007 and March 2009, received the payments in 2008. His company, Seacroft, received £650,000 in February 2008 from supplier Performance Brands. That June he received 380,000 US dollars (about £197,000) from Fashion and Sport, another supplier. Southwark Crown Court (pictured above) heard that Ronnie owed £11 million to Icelandic bank Kaupthing Singer Friedlander and agreed he would provide it with documents about his loans and assets . A third payment, again from Fashion and Sport, was made to Ronnie later that year, this time of 250,000 US dollars (about £134,000). Ronnie owed £11 million to Icelandic bank Kaupthing Singer Friedlander, and agreed he would provide it with documents about his loans and assets. But he falsified information about his assets and liabilities over these loans when he bought shares in JJB Sports. The group was founded in 1971 by Wigan entrepreneur Dave Whelan, who sold it in 2007. It ended up with huge debts after a series of acquisitions  between 2007 and 2009, and failed to keep pace with rival Sports Direct. JJB Sports collapsed after restructuring attempts failed, leaving it with £150 million debts. A report filed by administrators at Companies House shows sportswear group adidas was owed £10million, while Nike and Umbro were each owed £8 million. The sports clothing chain went into administration at the beginning of October 2012 and 2,200 employees were made redundant after administrators could find a buyer for only 20 stores. Sports Direct acquired control of 20 JJB stores when it bought the rump of the collapsed business. Most of them have now been closed. The court heard that the fraud could have shaken the market's trust in the company had it come to light at the time. Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC said: 'One cannot pin a fiscal health on a company which, by anyone's point of view, was going through tough times. 'But Mr Ronnie was trusted and hailed as this new and brilliant leader.' Self-made businessman Ronnie went from being able to raise £190 million on the market to fund his stake in JJB, to being a man 'broken financially', his defence lawyer, Jim Sturman QC, said. Mr Sturman said it had been a 'hellishly difficult year' for Ronnie, who was left in financial straits following the economic crash. He said: 'He left school before he was 16 and by virtue of hard work and charisma he managed to build himself up to a position where he could borrow £190 million to buy the stake in the company. 'And the crash caught him unawares as it caught others unaware.' Ball, 54, and Barrington, 52, covered up emails relating to the loans and asked a computer engineer to wipe any trace of the emails, the court heard. But the engineer was so concerned that he contacted the Serious Fraud Office. Ms Moore said it was 'sheer fluke' that he had the material and showed it to investigators. Ronnie, who did not give evidence in his own defence, was convicted of three counts of fraud, and two of furnishing false information. Ball, 54, from Sutton, Surrey, was convicted of two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice, as was Barrington, 52, from Sale, Cheshire. Ronnie was also banned from being a company director for eight years. Confiscation proceedings to claw back some of the costs of the case are expected to be launched. David Green, director of the Serious Fraud Office, said: 'These defendants contrived to hide information regarding their dealings from both JJB's board of directors and the SFO once its investigation began.

Online love scammers have stolen more than $25 million from Australians in just one year, prompting the consumer watchdog to join forces with government anti-money laundering agents in a bid to crack down. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will start sending about 400 letters every fortnight to suspected victims of online dating scams with warnings to stop sending money. Recipients will be identified if suspicious cross-border money movements are flagged with anti-money laundering agents as part of the new scam distribution project. Scroll down for video . Online love scammers have stolen more than $25 million from Australians in just one year, prompting the consumer watchdog to join forces with government anti-money laundering agents . There was a staggering $89 million in financial losses from scams last year, with dating and romance topping the list at more than $25 million, the ACCC found. There were close to 3,000 reports of relationship scams in 2013, with one third of people losing more than $10,000. ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said the aim was to disrupt the scam and therefore remove victims from scammers’ insidious clutches. 'Scammers invest considerable time and effort deceiving you into a fake romance, a fraudulent business partnership or a complex investment scheme. Their ultimate aim is to build your trust so they can steal your personal details and money,' she said. 'Victims of relationship scams often don’t know they’re a victim until it’s too late and their money is gone forever.' ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said the aim was to disrupt the scam and therefore remove victims from scammers' insidious clutches . 1. You’ve never met or seen them: scammers will say anything to avoid a ‘face-to-face’ meeting. 2.  They’re not who they appear to be: scammers steal photos and profiles from real people to create an appealing facade. 3.  They ask to chat with you privately: as many dating sites have processes in place to identify and remove scammers, . 4. You don’t know a lot about them: scammers are often less forthcoming about themselves. 5. They ask you for money:  once the connection’s been made - scammers will eventually ask you to transfer money. Raising awareness has been touted as the key to helping Australians protect themselves better, which is another important aspect of the project. 'People should be particularly vigilant in asking themselves who they are really dealing with when they meet the person online,' Ms Rickard said. 'Scammers use the internet to establish relationships behind a smoke screen, where they remain anonymous while connecting with potential victims around the globe. 'Alarm bells should go off if they request money, especially via wire transfer. This payment method is popular with scammers as it is almost impossible to trace and it is rare to recover money sent this way. 'If you suspect that you, a friend or a family member is being targeted by a scammer, the ACCC strongly urges you to stop sending any money and to contact us.' An Australian grandmother, whose online friendship cost her more than her lifesavings, met a tragic fate at the hands of a love scammer. Jette Jacobs flew to South Africa believing she was starting a new relationship with a 28-year-old man, but days after meeting him she was found dead in her apartment, 60 Minutes reported. The ACCC said it was working with state and federal counterparts on the project through the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce. The taskforce comprises of 23 government regulatory agencies and departments with responsibility for consumer protection regarding frauds and scams.\n",
      "269. Resigning: Ina Drew has resigned from JPMorgan Chase after the bank lost $2billion . The boss of the British-based trader thought to have cost one of the world's biggest banks $2billion in trading losses was herself paid $14million last year. Ina Drew, 54, is considered one of the most powerful women on Wall Street and has been at the head of JP Morgan Chase's London-based Chief Investment Office since February 2005. Regarded as a key lieutenant of chief executive Jamie Dimon, she was effectively in charge of Bruno Michel Iksil, the Frenchman nicknamed 'Voldemort' and 'the London Whale'. She . received a cash bonus of $4.7m, a share award of $7.1m, options worth . $1.5 million and a base salary of $750,000, according to regulatory . filings by the bank. It was also revealed today that two London-based executives were . forced out in the . wake of the fiasco. Achilles . Macris, who ran the London desk that made the botched trades, was . expected to depart along with one of his senior lieutenants, Javier . Martin-Artajo. The bank's ‘black hole’ - equivalent to . £1.2billion - was revealed during its second quarter amid fears . Mr Iksil's trades could cost JP Morgan a further £750 million in the . coming months. Shares in the bank dropped by 9.3 per cent  yesterday as U.S. and British regulators . launched investigations into the losses. The verdict from credit agencies has been grim, with Fitch knocking JP Morgan down a rating and Standard & Poor's putting the bank on a negative outlook. The slump knocked $14bn off the bank's equity value in what the Dow Jones index showed to have been the stock market's worst week of the year so far. Fellow finance giants Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also suffered as investors predicted the impact would spread. JP Morgan is America's largest bank, . holding £1.43trillion in outstanding loans and other assets, and employs . 240,000 people in 60 countries. This week it emerged that Mr Iksil . works under Ms Drew in the corporation's Chief Investment Office, where his job . was reportedly supposed to oversee mitigating risk. CEO . Jamie Dimon, who admitted JP Morgan had made 'egregious mistakes', issued a statement claiming that the bank had hit trouble. He said: ‘In hindsight, the new strategy was flawed, complex, poorly . reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored. Speculation: Bruno Michel Iksil, a London-based trader, dubbed Voldemort after Harry Potter's nemesis in the films, is also speculated to resign over the loss to America's largest bank . Others: A third executive, along with Drew and Bruno Michel Iksil, is also expected to resign but has thus far gone unnamed . ‘The portfolio has proved to be . riskier, more volatile and less effective as an economic hedge than we . thought. There are many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment. ‘It puts egg on our face and we deserve any criticism we get.’ Mr Dimon spoke as U.S. regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission prepared to look into how changes in the way JP Morgan calculates risk might have obscured the potential for these trades to do such colossal damage. Yet despite the accusations levelled at Mr Iksil, there has been no suggestion that his trading tactics broke any rules. The . Daily Mail has learned that the trader, a father of four in his . mid-forties, has been living and working in London for the past seven . years. U.S. bank Allfirst currency trader John Rusnack pleaded guilty to . $691million fraud in 2002 - and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Toshihide . Iguchi, a former car dealer, lost more than $1billion at Japanese bank . Daiwa in fraudulent trading over an 11-year period from 1984 onwards. The . Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) was seized by . regulators in 1991 after auditors reported huge losses from illegal . loans to corporate insiders and trades. It collapsed with $16billion . debts and 250,000 savers lost money. Japan's . Sumitomo Corporation trader Yasuo Hamanaka lost his firm $2.6billion in . unrecorded copper market trades and was jailed for eight years in 1996. British . trader Nick Leeson single-handedly destroyed 233-year-old Barings Bank . in 1995 by making losses and setting up a secret account to hide them. He was jailed for six-and-a-half years. In his Bloomberg trading profile he talks of being able to ‘walk on water’ being ‘humble’ but in the City he has been nicknamed ‘Lord Voldemort ‘ - after Harry Potter’s nemesis - along with the names ‘London Whale’ and ‘White Whale.’ He was given the ‘Voldemort’ nickname because he was seen as such a ‘scary and powerful’ force in the City. One trader explained: ‘It was a play on the Harry Potter theme when people were frightened of Lord Voldemort and his powers and referred to him as ‘’He Who Must Not Be Named\".' In reality, according to friends and family, Mr Iksil is not a ‘larger than life figure.’ He rents a flat in Earls Court, West London, where he stays from Monday until Thursday. He then returns to Paris for a long weekend where he spends time with his wife Karen and the couple’s four children. Last night his sister - 41-year-old Sandrine Iksil - who lives in Leicester and works for a software company in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, told the Daily Mail: ‘Bruno rarely talks about his work and if you met him you would not think he is a trader in the City. ‘He is very quiet and is a family . man. He does not own a flash sports car and his main hobby would be . cooking. He enjoys being in the kitchen. He certainly has never talked . to me about his work. ‘He also insists on getting home each weekend to be with his wife and children. He works from home on Fridays. ‘I last saw him at Easter when he came to visit with his wife and children. They are just a normal family.’ Mr Iksil’s family originally hails from Russia before his ancestors settled in France. The dark-haired trader is reported to . have earned has earned about $100million (£62.2million) a year for JP . Morgan’s Chief Investment Office in recent years. Mr Iksil joined JP Morgan in 2005 having previously worked at the French investment bank Natixis (KN) from 1999 to 2003. He originally graduated in engineering from the Ecole Centrale in Paris. JP Morgan said yesterday they had informed the UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) of their situation. News: The company's stock plunged almost 7 per cent in after-hours trading after the loss was announced.  Other bank stocks, including Citigroup and Bank of America, suffered heavy losses as well (file picture) Mr Iksil was brought into the CIO unit to head its credit desk, where trades were vetted by management. The losses are an acute embarrassment for Mr Dimon after JP Morgan was considered in a healthy enough position to take over investment bank Bear Stearns and consumer bank Washington Mutual when they collapsed in 2008. The bank quickly paid off its $25bn federal bailout and initially enjoyed a good relationship with the Obama administration. In April, when the issue was first raised in financial papers and websites, Mr Dimon dismissed the matter as a ‘tempest in a teapot’. He himself earned a staggering £15 million last year and has publicly opposed new regulations being placed on banks, suggesting he has turned against the President. JP Morgan’s position has been made more uncomfortable by what those in the City called the ‘Volcker’ effect. Former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker - as well as Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King - claimed that investment banks should not be allowed to trade on their own accounts. As regulators continue to figure out how this restriction can be imposed, it remains unclear whether such a rule would have stopped JP Morgan from trading in the way that it did. Bad news: The trading loss is an embarrassment for a bank that came through the 2008 financial crisis in much better health than its peers. It kept clear of risky investments that hurt many other banks (file picture) Trying: JPMorgan wants to unload the portfolio in question in a 'responsible' manner to minimise the cost to its shareholders.

      "270. Ian Ousey (outside court today), 51, was chief financial officer at FremantleMedia when he fleeced the media company so he could keep up with instalments on his dream home in Portugal . A former executive at the company behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent was jailed for 40 months today for stealing £225,000 from the producer to pay for his holiday home. Ian Ousey, 51, was chief financial officer at FremantleMedia when he fleeced the media company so he could keep up with instalments on his dream home in Portugal. He submitted false invoices for four years and was only caught out when senior colleagues spotted a gaping hole in the firm’s finances and launched an audit. Suspicious transactions were discovered in 2012 by FremantleMedia’s group financial director Mark Riddleston. The company credit card was also used to pay for vehicles, mobile phones and other unauthorised expenses. But a charge relating to the corporate card was dropped when investigators failed to distinguish legitimate claims from potentially fraudulent ones. Ousey, who lives in a £1.9million five-bedroom detached home in Ascot, Berkshire, has since paid back the full amount he stole, as well as £1million to cover the cost of FremantleMedia’s internal inquiry. He is also believed to have surrendered his full pension to the company. Today, prosecutor James Benson said the fraudster spent thousands on ‘flights to Brazil and Australia and so on and so forth’. Mr Benson revealed Ousey has already repaid FremantleMedia £1.25million after civil proceedings were launched against him. The sum included the false invoices, plus abuses of the company expenses system and the cost of the internal auditing procedure, the court heard. Sentencing him, Judge Peter Clarke noted Ousey had damaged ‘his family life and his self-respect and the respect with which he is held by his spouse and children’. He said it was highly unlikely Ousey would work again as a chartered accountant, adding he ‘could not contemplate the question of a suspended sentence’. Samuel Parish, defending, said Ousey, who worked for FremantleMedia for 23 years, began siphoning money from the company when he could not afford payments on his holiday home. Ousey, who worked at the company behind The X Factor (above) and Britain’s Got Talent, was jailed for 40 months today for stealing £225,000 from the producer to pay for the holiday home . Ousey, who graduated in economics and statistics from the University of Exeter, spent more than a decade in senior finance roles in the TV industry . The barrister said his client’s career was ‘finished’. ‘He is extremely remorseful about it, not just because he has been found out but because of the disgrace he has put brought onto his family and himself. ‘He has kicked himself well and truly in the teeth. ‘He’s been to Portugal with his wife, he’s decided to buy a property which he had to pay for in instalments. ‘At the last stretch there was some hiccup and he was unable to make the final instalment, the conditions were such that if he was unable to pay he would have lost the whole lot. ‘He submitted a false invoice for a company that did not exist but which had a similar name to a company that did supply to [FremantleMedia]. ‘He’s stated that he couldn’t stop, but he’s paid everything back.’ He added: ‘He’s a man with children in paid schools, and his whole way of life has gone completely. ‘He can’t get a job, he’s had to inform his professional body and has been struck off their rolls.’ Mr Parish added: ‘And now what he is most worried about is the welfare of his family because he’s left them in really difficult circumstances, and Mr Ousey would like to get this dealt with as soon as possible.’ Ousey, who graduated in economics and statistics from the University of Exeter, spent more than a decade in senior finance roles in the TV industry. He trained at accounting firm PwC in the 1980s before taking a job in Monaco with Grundy Worldwide, the Australian production company behind Neighbours, the long-running daytime soap opera. Ousey then went on to work for the European entertainment giant RTL when it bought out Grundy, and then FremantleMedia when the companies merged. After leaving the company last year, he was made redundant from a rival firm in April and then worked as a self-employed consultant. On his online social networking LinkedIn profile, he describes himself as ‘a highly experienced CFO, with a reputation for significant contribution to the business, and delivering the best commercial outcome’. Ousey admitted fraud by abuse of position between October 30, 2008 and November 30, 2012.\n",
      "271. A dying man ended up living in poverty after his 'good Samaritan' neighbour stole his savings to buy scratchcards and designer clothes, a court heard. Carlos Machado, 55, was supposedly caring for Brian . Farlow, who lived in the same apartment block, but instead plundered his bank account, transferring more than £25,000 to himself. Cancer patient Mr Farlow, 63 was left living in squalor with rotting food in . his kitchen, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. Abusing power: Carlos Machado, right, was able to plunder the account of cancer patient Brian Farlow, left,  after the dying man signed an authorisation form for his 'carer' neighbour . Mr Farlowe's living situation was uncovered by his family when they visited his flat in Whitham, Essex, in 2011. Mr Farlow died from lung and bone cancer in November, two months after his family found out what was happening, the court heard. Machado was able to take advantage of the 63-year-old after Mr Farlow had signed an authorisation . form allowing Machado to withdraw money from his account with his permission. The court heard £25,255 belonging to Mr Farlow had passed through Machado's bank account, all of which had been spent. Prosecutors alleged Machado stole £45,000 from Mr Farlow and spent it on scratchcards, gambling and designer clothing. Gambling man: Machado told Chelmsford Crown Court, pictured, he intended to take part in TV show Deal or No Deal and use his winnings to repay Mr Farlow . Machado claimed the amount involved was £15,000 and it was always his intention to pay it back. He told the court one way he was going . to return the money was to take part in the TV quiz show Deal or No . Deal, but show bosses said he never applied. Richard Conley, mitigating, told the court Machado had serious mental health problems, adding that Machado's condition had worsened in the past year. Judge Charles Gratwicke said Machado's actions were a serious breach of trust, as he sentenced him to two years suspended prison sentence, 200 hours of unpaid work and imposed a mental health treatment order. Machado has no assets that can be seized but if his financial circumstances improve, the authorities can pursue him in a bid to recoup the money at a later date. Machado had denied stealing £45,000 and a jury could not agree on a verdict after a trial in January. He was found guilty of fraud by abusing his position, but was cleared of seven other fraud and theft charges.\n",

The . changes come after a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice that people have the . 'right to be forgotten' - so they can have Google search results removed if they tarnish their reputation. Over 12,000 people across Europe have used the form since Google launched the online form . yesterday morning. If those requests are granted, anyone searching for those people on Google will not be shown the aspects of their past that they have deemed to be embarrassing or damaging - making internet searches fundamentally less useful. Google requests: At one point, yesterday, Google said it was getting 20 requests per minute from people asking for their information to be taken down . At one point Google said it was getting 20 requests per minute. But the . ruling has already been criticised after early indications that around . 12 per cent of applications were related to paedophilia. A further 30 per cent concern fraud . and 20 per cent were about people's arrests or convictions. Along with requests from paedophiles, many other applications have come from corrupt public figures and . criminals desperate to hide their past. An actor who had an affair with a teenager, a celebrity's child who was convicted of criminal offices and a man who . tried to kill members of his family were among the first requests. The company has set up a team of . employees to deal with requests and sift through applications from people desperate to . have personal information removed from search results. The team will decide exactly which grievances should be honoured under the European court ruling and which should not. However, the company said it will not honour every application and will look at each case based on its merit. These include cases connected with recent criminal convictions, professional malpractice and the conduct of government officials. WHAT IS THE LINK? Those seeking to have information about them removed can visit the legal section of Google's website or visit the link: https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch . On this page, a form allows users to put in a search removal request under EU data law.WHO CAN USE THE FORM? Only EU citizens are allowed to submit a request via the form and apply to have their links removed if their legal name appears. They will have to explain why the link should be taken down.WHAT REQUESTS WILL BE CONSIDERED? All requests will be considered but Google, but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest, the company has said it will not remove all cases.WHAT CAN I DO IF A CASE IS NOT RESOLVED? In Britain users can contact the Information Commissioner's Office or take Google to court. However, if these types of cases . cannot be resolved by Google they may end up being looked at by . Britain's privacy watchdog the Information Commisioner's Office or go to . a higher court. It means that Google now finds itself in the prickly position of having to balance privacy concerns against the principles of free expression and 'the right to know.' Critics say the EU ruling has already created a divide between how Google generates search results about some people in Europe and the rest of the world. For now at least, Google will only scrub personal information spanning 32-nations in Europe. It means that Googling the same person in the United States and dozens of other countries could look much different than it does from Europe. And although the court ruling currently applies to 28 countries in the European Union, Google is extending the 'right to be forgotten' to four other countries — Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. More than 500 million people live in the area affected by Google's potential purge of personal information from its European search results. Google said it has established a seven-person . advisory committee including Eric Schmidt, Jimmy Wales who is . Wikipedia's founder and Jose Luis Piñar, former director of Spain's Data . Protection Authority to look at the issues. Concern: Co-founder and CEO Larry Page has warned that a European court ruling on 'the right to be forgotten' will help corrupt governments around the world . However, in an . interview with the Financial Times, Google's co-founder Larry Page warned that the new law will be used by other . governments to do bad . things. He said: 'Other people are going to pile on, probably... for reasons most Europeans would find negative.'\n",
      "273. Accused: Frank Onyeachonam, 40, is accused of swindling more than £250,000 out of pensioners by telling them they had won the lottery and asking for 'activation fees' A man swindled pensioners out of their life savings by telling them they had won millions of pounds on the lottery, a court has heard. Frank Onyeachonam, 40, is said to have targeted elderly American victims with his scheme billed as a 'life-changing prize'. Believing they had struck good fortune, victims were allegedly persuaded to pay a small fee to release their winnings. But he then continued to request further 'modest sums' - amounting to more than £250,000, it is said. Prosecutor Joel Smith told the Old Bailey in London: ‘By its very nature this type of fraud plays on the vulnerable and often elderly. ‘Indeed, . the scam could be seen as doubly cruel - not only were some of the . victims left to come to terms with the financial loss and the impact of . being duped, but also with the fact that they had not, as they genuinely . believed they had, won a life changing sum of money.’ Onyechonam, of east London, is accused of running the seven-year scam between 2005 and 2012, sending out letters to potential victims, describing the foreign prize they had supposedly won. The pensioners were told to pay a modest sum to an 'agent' - Onyechonam - who would 'release' their winnings, the jury heard. This money was then said to have been wired back to the UK. Wire transfer payments were made to the UK with Onyeachonam’s late associate Carvin Ehirim receiving payments of £80,365.74. Co-defendant Lawrencia Emenyonu, 38, is accused of laundering the victim’s cash through an adult vocational schooling company called Renciae, which she was director of. Her partner Bernard Armah, 51, is said to have helped after stashing ‘large and unexplained’ sums of money from his wife in his personal account. Emenyonu allegedly received £59,883.67 in 2012 and £25,167.73 during 2012. Western Union payments totalling at least £256,000 can be attributed to the fraud but the total amount of loss is unknown. Joyce Abbot, 80, was swindled out of £60,000 after receiving a letter to her house in Maine, US, telling her she had won £1,950,000 in an Australian lottery on 30 July 2010. Standing trial: Co-accused Lawrencia Emenyonu, 38 (left), allegedly laundered victims' money through an adult schooling company she owns. Her partner Bernard Armah, 51 (right), is said to have helped stashing cash . She was asked to ring an agent called ‘Jeff Lloyds’, said to be one of Onyeachonam’s pseudonyms, who claimed he would help her obtain her winnings if she paid ‘activation fees’. The SIM card with ‘Jeff Lloyds’ number was found next to Onyeachonam’s bed when he was arrested, jurors heard. Seattle resident David Vawter, 63, was informed he had won £2.8m in an Australian lottery, then asked to contact ‘Dr Jeff Lloyds’ who demanded a series of payments for fake taxes and administrative fees. Once hooked, Onyeachonam bled up to £40,000 from Mr Vawter, who still owes over £20,000 to his parents and brother, the court heard. There are 13 known victims of the fraud in America and one victim has been traced in England . Onyeachonam, of east London, denies conspiracy to defraud between January 2005 and December 2012. Emenyonu and Armah, both of north London, deny money laundering for the same period of time. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

The man was arrested in Leeds - close to the supermarket's headquarters in Bradford - earlier this morning following the theft of payroll information from a central database. West Yorkshire Police confirmed that a man had been arrested on suspicion of making or supplying an article for use in fraud and said he remains in custody. Leak: The man was arrested in Leeds - close to the supermarket's headquarters in Bradford - earlier this morning following the theft of payroll information from a central database . Detective Chief Inspector Gary Hooks of West Yorkshire Police said: 'An employee of Morrisons has been arrested in Leeds this morning in connection with an investigation into the theft of data from the company.' The theft was seen as a fresh blow to Morrisons, especially as it came just one day after Britain’s fourth biggest supermarket tumbled to a £176million annual loss and issued a profits warning. The warning sent shares down by 12 per cent and saw the supermarket pledge to cut prices to compete with Aldi and Lidl. The company said the data theft affected staff from all levels of the organisation including the board, but would not comment on whether chief executive Dalton Philips was among them. Probe: Chief executive Dalton Philips is heading the company's investigation into the hack . The supermarket said it became aware . of the data theft last Thursday, hours after it announced financial . results to the City and that Mr Philips was leading the response. It . wrote to all employees with an email address to inform them of the data . theft, while managers were also informing workers at its sites. Morrisons . did not say how many of its 130,000 employees were affected, although . initial reports suggested it could be as many as 100,000. The . leak was revealed by the Telegraph and Argus, a local newspaper based . in Morrisons' home town of Bradford, after 'a concerned Morrisons . shopper' sent the data to it. It is not known for how long the information was available. Morrisons . said: 'We can confirm there has been no loss of customer data and no . colleague will be left financially disadvantaged.' It added that it was urgently reviewing internal data security measures, with an . investigation into the incident to be led by Mr Phillips. Employees took to social media to vent their anger at the company after the publication was revealed. Many criticised the company for announcing the news on Facebook before all staff had been personally informed. One wrote: 'A hack? So why weren't these details encrypted and what not?'

      "275. A wealthy businessman who illegally claimed more than £35,000 in benefits despite owning a £2million property empire has been jailed. Mohsen Sabet, 48, had over £800,000 stashed in a string of bank accounts and ran two shops. But he still tried to get away with claiming thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money over seven years. Wood Green Crown Court heard Mohsen Sabet, 48, illegally claimed more than £35,000 in benefits despite owning a £2million property empire . Sabet even changed his name from Mohsen Aboudarda by deed poll in 2004 to avoid being caught out by the three local authorities he deceived, Wood Green Crown Court heard. He was eventually exposed by Barnet Council's fraud squad after suspicions were raised by the neighbouring authority in Enfield, London. Sabet, from Whetstone, London, was jailed for nine months on March 7 after pleading guilty to ten charges of benefit fraud. Sentencing, Judge James Patrick described the frauds as 'systematic, deliberate and dishonest, motivated by greed and a sense of personal injustice'. Barnet Council leader Richard Cornelius said: 'This was a truly brazen attempt by a man who owned a business and significant assets to cheat the system and claim benefits which are intended to help those in genuine need.' The court heard Sabet illegally claimed housing and council tax benefit from Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Councils, as well as receiving financial assistance from the Department for Work and Pensions. This included more than £6,500 from Barnet Council under his previous name of Mohsen Aboudarda. They found he owned and was running two luggage shops in Enfield and Tottenham and that he owned several homes in the name of Sabet. The benefits cheat also owned four properties, three of them outright, and had 17 different bank accounts at one time containing a total of £800,000. He later also admitted to having assets in Iran worth more than £1million. Confiscation proceedings have now been initiated to recover the money Sabet illegally claimed.\n",
      "276. Asylum: Banker Andrei Borodin is wanted on criminal charges in Moscow but has been granted asylum by the Home Office . A Russian banking tycoon who owns Britain’s most expensive house has been given asylum in this country – prompting fury in Moscow. Andrey Borodin, 45, fled his homeland two years ago accusing the Kremlin of politically- motivated persecution. He bought the £140million grade II listed mansion called Park Place, near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where he lives with his family. But his presence in Britain has angered the Russian authorities who want him extradited to stand trial for alleged fraud. Mr Borodin says the charges were trumped up when he dared to accuse a key ally of President Vladimir Putin of corruption. Mr Borodin’s lawyer confirmed he had been granted refugee status in the UK, meaning the Government has accepted he could be harmed by the Russian state if sent home. The decision will further undermine Britain’s strained relations with Moscow, with the office of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev issuing an angry response. The Russian leader’s press secretary Natalya Timakova said the accusations against Mr Borodin, were fully justified. ‘There is now a practice of seeking political asylum,  especially in England, whereby it doesn’t matter what the seeker has done,’ she said. ‘What  matters is how loudly he shouts about political persecution.’ While the Home Office did not comment, Borodin's lawyer in Moscow,  Dmitry Kharitonov, said: 'Yes, he got political asylum in Britain. This status is not time-limited.' In October it was revealed that the fugitive had been the target of a surveillance operation on the M4 close to his home.  'It might have been someone from the Russian security service, it might have been criminals,' he said at the time. He bought the £140million grade II listed mansion called Park Place, near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where he lives with his family . His presence in Britain has angered the Russian authorities who want him extradited to stand trial for alleged fraud. He is pictured here with girlfriend Tatiana . Russia has put Borodin on its international wanted list and strongly denies claims that Medvedev or anyone else sought to persecute the banker. The Russian premier's press secretary Natalya Timakova said today that the accusations against Borodin - who fled to London in April 2011 - are of 'pure criminal character' involving Bank of Moscow, which he formerly owned. She issued what is expected to be the first blast of many from Moscow on this asylum case. 'There now a practice of seeking the political asylum - specially in England - whereby it doesn't matter what the seeker has done,' she said. 'What matters is how loudly he shouts about political persecution - and this will become a guarantee that the asylum will be granted.' She accused Britain of ignoring that Interpol 'is after him'. Moscow also insisted today that it would continue to demand Borodin's extradition from Britain. But he claimed today: 'Any political asylum seeker must submit the application together with recordings and any other proof showing the political character of the persecution in his native country. My lawyers submitted all necessary proof.' Borodin claimed that he was ousted from the bank because it was needed as a 'pension pot' for Medvedev.  He alleged he was forced to sell his stake in the bank for £465 million, which he claimed was half its true value. He fled Russia after being told he faced a probe into corruption involving loans at the bank, accusations he claims are trumped up. Russia has put Borodin on its international wanted list and strongly denies claims that Medvedev or anyone else sought to persecute the banker . Borodin in accused of improperly loaning £285 million to shell companies which switched the money to Yelena Baturina, wife of long-time Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who was ousted by Medvedev.  She, too, is now based mainly in London and denies wrongdoing. The banker claimed there was a political decision to take control over the Bank of Moscow, and that it was executed by VTB president Andrei Kostin and Igor Yusufov,  a special representative of the then President Medvedev. 'Yusufov told me straight forwardly that he was acting at the order and in interests of Medvedev, who decided to gain state control over the Bank of Moscow,' he said. Yusufov claimed a 'future financial empire' was being created for Medvedev,  who he nicknamed the 'young man', a term supposedly relating to his second-fiddle status to Vladimir Putin.  Yusufov dismissed the claims against him as 'lies and slander'. Bank of Moscow was taken over by state-controlled VTB bank in a $14 billion bailout in July 2011, the biggest rescue in Russian financial history. The Russian authorities blame Borodin for its problems. Borodin was listed as 117th richest person in Russia by Forbes-2012 with an estimated fortune of $800 million.\n",
      "277. A British witch doctor who became one of the most prolific conwomen in history may have pocketed a staggering £5m during her 12-year scam, it emerged today. Juliette D’Souza, 59, was jailed for 10 years at London’s Blackfriars Crown Court last Friday after she persuaded vulnerable 'patients' to hand over their . life savings - insisting the money would be hung from a sacred tree in the . Amazon as a sacrifice. Initially she was believed to have made around £1million from the con, which she used to pay for first class flights, antique furniture and a £3,000 Hermes handbag. But a senior police officer in charge of the investigation said the victims involved in the court case were 'just a fraction' of the elaborate scheme. Conwoman: A senior police officer has said Juliette D'Souza (pictured left when she was younger) may have pocketed £5million during her elaborate scam. The 59 year old was jailed for 10 years last Friday (right) Detective Constable Fiona Graham, from . the Metropolitan Police, said: 'That’s £1m from a handful of people, but . she’s been doing it for decades. I can easily believe it’s more than . £5m.' D’Souza, of Hampstead, was jailed for 23 counts of fraud and deception spanning from 1998 to 2010. The self-proclaimed healer told potential victims she had . helped cure John Cleese’s daughter of cancer, boasted of knowing . Princess Diana and claimed she could introduce a young . singer to Simon Cowell. Advertising her services . in Tatler magazine, she charged just £35 for a consultation but then . demanded huge sums to be used as the 'sacrifices' in Suriname, South America. The witch doctor of Hampstead: The 59-year-old (pictured leaving Blackfriars Crown Court after a hearing) spent the money on luxury goods she never used . There she claimed two other shamans would perform . rituals around the money before it was sent back with all the victims' problems resolved - but the money was never returned. Police fear the bogus shaman healer may . have used links to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead and a Camden . Council care home to target dozens more vulnerable victims. The hospital has confirmed that a staff member, who still works at the hospital, faced disciplinary action after directing a patient to D’Souza in July 2012. It allegedly led to a seriously ill Hampstead man being told he would 'die on the operating table' by D’Souza if he did not hand over more than £10,000. Ms Graham added: 'If a nurse at the Royal Free recommended D’Souza to one victim, knowing what I know, they must have genuinely believed in her. 'There could be a whole other group of victims.' D’Souza has also been investigated for two other high value fraud schemes. One involved allegedly cheating Filipino immigrants seeking UK visas which may have earned her another £1m. She has also been connected to a police probe linked to the Branch Hill care home, where her parents lived. Ms Graham, of the Met Police, admitted police were wrong to dismiss the case in 2007, when many of D’Souza’s victims first visited Holborn Police Station. The senior officer, who along with Detective Constable Linda Kernot was highly praised by the trial judge, said: 'It was the wrong decision - and the judge confirmed it was the wrong decision. 'However, I can understand why that decision was made.' Ms Graham said there was a lot of evidence of more victims, including one who allegedly gave D’Souza £600,000, but did not want to take part in the court case. 'I believe she’s been defrauding people for decades,' she said. 'I believe it’s a natural thing for her to do and that she won’t even be able to stop herself in prison. 'There are many more victims out there and we’re actively encouraging any further victims to come forward.' Judge Ian Karsten, QC, branded D’Souza the worst confidence trickster he 'had ever heard of'. He said she not only 'ruined' victims financially, she 'dominated' them and 'wrought havoc' on their lives. Victims: Hampstead osteopath Keith Bender, left, referred clients to D'Souza in the belief she could help. Opera singer Silvia Eaves handed over £256,000 for help with stomach problems and to invest in a clinic in Peru . As he . jailed her, he said: 'It is the worst case of confidence fraud that I have ever . had to deal with or indeed that I have ever heard of. 'The . most serious aspect of this case is that you wrecked the lives of a . number of your victims and you have done it out of pure greed.' Following . a five-week trial the jury took only an hour to convict the serial . conwoman of all 23 charges of fraud and obtaining property by deception. Judge . Karsten said D’Souza had ripped off her victims by making strange . claims of cash 'sacrifices' hanging from a sacred tree in the Amazon . jungle in Suriname. She . funded a luxury lifestyle by extracting huge sums from desperate people, . some with terminal illnesses or cancer-stricken relatives. Her victims were so much under her . spell during the 12-year scam that one woman, who cannot be named, had . an abortion because D’Souza told her to. And another, Ruth Fillingham, even sold her home after being told that it was 'spooked'. Judge Karsten also condemned D’Souza for trying to pin the fraud on her osteopath friend Keith Bender. And, . by failing to plead guilty, she forced her terrified victims to give . evidence to the court and 'relive the extremely unpleasant experiences' while lacking the courage to go into the witness box herself. Voodoo dolls: D'Souza's con was exposed when Mr Bender and property manager Keith Mcmahon grew suspicious and broke into her four flats at Willoughby Road in Hampstead, north London . The . judge said there were undoubtedly further victims, including one 'who . is no longer alive' - a reference to the aborted child. 'You were able to exercise considerable influence, indeed a spell over these victims,' said Judge Karsten. 'They . did exactly what you required them to do. They were terrified, in many . cases, of the consequences of disobeying your instructions. 'They . lost all their autonomy and they became entirely dependent on you. You . saw to it that they were cut off from their own friends and family. 'You managed to dominate these individuals and make them bow to your will.' D’Souza’s . web was finally untangled in 2007 as she made a series of mistakes . which aroused her victims’ suspicions. She claimed to have attended St . Hilliard’s College, Oxford, which does not exist and got the name of . Princess Diana’s sister wrong. Far from having a university education, she was a former . cleaner, receptionist and temp. The . woman who had an abortion realised she had been scammed and went to . Hampstead police station in north London, but said officers ‘laughed in . my face’. This left her . so angry she forced her way into D’Souza’s home with the help of Mr . Bender, who was paying the rent on that property, and three others. Inside they found bags of shopping, an abandoned monkey and a voodoo treasure trove – which included . drawings of an ‘evil eye’, burned photos and a brand new barrister’s . wig. D’Souza would give her 'customers' detailed instructions about how the money was to be paid - always in . cash and in a brown envelope. Part of her system was to demand a full-length photograph from each victim. Pet: Mr Bender had been visiting one flat to feed D'Souza's pet monkey, Joey, but did not dare enter the remaining flats for fear they were cursed. The monkey was later adopted by the TV comic Stephen Fry . One . victim - who was told to pay £18,000 or her partner would die - said: . 'I was absolutely terrified. I was living in fear and doing what I was . told.' Another was 82-year-old former opera singer Sylvia Eaves, who was duped out of more than £350,000 by D’Souza between 1998 and 2010. The widow, whom the judge described as a 'delightful lady', handed over the money for various reasons including help with a stomach problem and to 'save' her ill sister. 'I’m relieved that she won’t be doing it to anybody else,' Mrs Eaves said at her sentencing. 'I feel terribly sad that somebody who is so clever would resort to that, especially as she was a friend of mine. I feel terribly let down that she could behave like that. 'She relieved me of a lot of money but I’m still here. I was gullible, I suppose, but my sister was very ill at the time.' A mother of a ten-year-old boy with . Down’s Syndrome who was also conned out of £42,000 when D’Souza claimed . she could cure his behavioural problems. Other victims included retired solicitor Richard Collier-Wright, who paid £7,000 to cure his terminal leukaemia, while former photographer Jocelyn Bain-Hogg, who handed D’Souza thousands to improve the health of his mother who was having heart surgery. A couple, who cannot be named, gave tens of thousands to the fraudster after she claimed she could help with their child’s disability and behavioural problems. Another victim, Geoffrey Wheeler, handed over around £160,000 to 'protect' him from being made redundant but was left in financial ruin. Her barrister, Stephen Fidler, told the court D’Souza’s elderly mother had been unwell for a considerable time and she visits her every day. But the judge told her: 'I find no mitigating factors in your case at all.' Gear: Piles of rubbish filled the flats and stacks of carrier bags from designer stores littered the rooms .\n",
      "278. Google's chief executive has bowed to a landmark 'right to be forgotten' ruling and has today introduced a new form letting people apply to get themselves removed from search results. The . changes come after the European Court of Justice ruled people have the . 'right to be forgotten' - meaning Google searches linked to individuals . can taken down if they tarnish their reputation. But in his first interview since the decision, company co-founder Larry Page suggested authoritarian . states around the world will see the changes as a green light to . internet censorship. Co-founder and CEO Larry Page has warned that a European court ruling on 'the right to be forgotten' will help corrupt governments around the world . In an interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'It will be used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things. 'Other people are going to pile on, probably... for reasons most Europeans would find negative.' He also told of his fears that the ruling, seen as the biggest ever privacy setback for an online company, would discourage would-be internet entrepreneurs from setting up new businesses. Google is launching the online form . today to allow people to have links to information taken down from the website's search results. The . company will review the deluge of requests it is expected to receive, . with some links expected to be taken down within weeks. From today, Google's website will contain a form for users who want links to information about them removed . The . ruling has been criticised after it emerged many of the 3,000-plus requests . the company has already received were from corrupt public figures and . criminals desperate to hide their past. Google . says it wants to strike a balance between people's right to privacy and . maintaining links to information that is in the public interest. A . company spokesman said: 'In implementing this decision, we will assess . each individual request and attempt to balance the privacy rights of the . individual with the public's right to know and distribute information.' People who want links about them taken down from Google will have to give the company the URL or web address of the offending webpage, their home country and an explanation of why they think the link should be removed. Google insists 'humans, not algorithms' will make the decision after looking into the applicant's case. The plans only extend to local or national sites, e.g. Google.co.uk, and searches in Google.com will still show the person's undesired results. Cases where Google does not agree with the applicant will be passed on to national data protection agencies. Searchers will then be notified if a link has been removed, although the original webpage will remain online. Mr . Page said the powerful and famous will still be scrutinised online, . adding: 'I'm a public figure. There are lots of things that are written . about me that I'm sure are untrue. I kind of deal with that.' The . original information about people will not be removed from the internet . and will still exist on the relevant website, but web users will not . see it in their Google searches or be able to link to it through the . site. Cases . which Google refuses to act upon will be handed over to national data . protection agencies, such as Britain's Information Commissioner's . Office, which are braced for a flood of requests in coming months. Germany, . whose citizens have contributed 40 per cent of the requests to Google so . far, is even considering bringing in a new division of courts to hear . internet privacy disputes. Concerns have been raised that the ruling could . lead to censorship after it emerged that an actor who had an affair with a teenager, a celebrity's child who was convicted of criminal offices and a man who . tried to kill members of his family were among the first requests . received. Around . 30 per cent of the requests Google has been sent so far concern fraud, . 12 per are related to paedophilia and 20 per cent concern reports of . people's arrests or convictions. The . original case regarding the right to be forgotten was brought by a . Spanish man who claimed his privacy had been infringed by an auction . notice for his repossessed home. Under . Article 17 of the European Data Protection Regulation, internet users . who are mentioned in data have the right to 'obtain from the controller . the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from . further dissemination of such data'. Yahoo . Inc which also operates a search engine in Europe, has previously said . it is 'carefully reviewing' the decision to assess the impact for its . business and its users. Microsoft, which operates the Bing search engine, has previously declined to comment on the ruling.\n",
      "279. A brothel madam has been jailed for  trafficking woman into the UK and scaring them into prostitution  by making them eat live snakes in an African black magic ceremony. Lizzy Idahosa, 24, and her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, made more than £70,000 out of the Nigerian women, who were terrified with voodoo and made to see a witch doctor for a sinister 'juju' ceremony. Heavily pregnant Idahosa was sentenced to eight years today and broke down as she was told she would be separated from her child when it is born. Jailed: : Lizzy Idahosa, 24, found guilty of people trafficking after she forced two Nigerian women into prostitution by making them eat snakes in an African black magic ceremony, while her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, was convicted of money laundering . Omoruyi was sentenced to two years behind bars. Judge Tom Crowther told Idahosa she was the scheme's 'prime mover adding: 'You targeted vulnerable young women, offering them the hope of new lives, all the while knowing you would keep them in a kind of hell, from place to place at your whim, forced to pay an entirely arbitrary debt with their bodies, day in, day out over a period of years.' Idahosa was convicted of trafficking the women, inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property, while Omoruyi was found guilty of money laundering. During the couple's trial at Cardiff Crown Court, the jury was told that the two  victims, aged 23 and 29, had their pubic hair shaved and forced to eat live snakes and snails as part of the ritual, and then flown to Britain in the belief that they were going to find a better life. Speaking about her horrific ordeal the 29-year-old said: 'It was not a big snake, but it was alive.I just closed my eyes and put it in my mouth. She added: 'They told me if I messed if up, I would get sent back to Nigeria and Lizzy would kill me. I wanted to stop. I was ashamed of myself and I had no life.' When the women arrived in the UK they were put to work as prostitutes, working in brothels at massage parlours across England and Wales. Heavily pregnant Idahosa (left) was jailed for eight years, while Omoruyi (right) was sentenced to two years . They were told they had to give all the money they earned to Idahosa, and believed the black magic curses would make them go insane or die if they refused. 'The couple were involved in the exploitation of two women brought into the UK from Nigeria to work as prostitutes,' said Caroline Rees, prosecuting, during the trial. 'They were bound to this by something called a juju ritual. It was a ceremonial ritual used to full effect to terrify both women into doing what was demanded of them. 'It was used to ensure compliance, secrecy, and they believed if they broke the bond dire consequences would follow: illness, madness, infertility or death. 'They genuinely believed the powers would work.' The offences came to light after police arrested a 23-year-old Nigerian woman at the Ambassador Suite brothel in Cardiff, in June 2013. She told officers she had been living rough in Nigeria after her mother died and had wanted to travel to the UK to find her father. Investigation: The offences came to light after police arrested a 23-year-old Nigerian woman at the Ambassador Suite brothel in Cardiff, in June 2013 . She had then met a woman, claiming to be Idahosa's sister, who promised to make arrangements for her to travel to London, and as part of the agreement had to take part in the ceremony. 'She did not know what was expected of her,' said Ms Rees, who said the woman had been able to pass through immigration at Heathrow. 'She was taken to a premises full of women dressed in their underwear. There was no explanation as to what was going on but it soon became clear.' The woman started to work as a prostitute and was forced to have sexual intercourse with seven or eight men every day, working in brothels across the UK, including in Cardiff and Swansea. When interviewed, she claimed she had given Idahosa £45,000. The second victim told the court she had paid the defendants £31,400 over two years after working in brothels in Cardiff, Swansea, Barking and East Croydon, and said she had worked in South Wales for a year and eight months. The woman, who like her fellow victim cannot be named for legal reasons, said she had stopped working and changed her sim card so Idahosa could not contact her. However, within a month she received a phone call from her mother in Nigeria. 'I had a call from my mum who told me Lizzy's people had been to her house and threatened her,' the victim told the jury. 'Lizzy said if I did not pay her she would kill my mum and make me go mad.' Idahosa and Omoruyi, who were arrested at their home in London, denied any wrong doing. But police checked their bank accounts and found a series of transfers with Omoruyi acting as a 'financial middle man'. Idahosa had denied forcing the women to take part in a black magic ceremony, but claimed that she herself had been trafficked into the UK and forced to work as a prostitute. She told the jury she did not know the two women had been trafficked. 'It was only when I told them I was trafficked into the country that I found out they were trafficked,' she said. Idahosa, who is heavily pregnant, said she made an oath with her trafficker before leaving Nigeria and was forced to eat the roast heart of a cockerel. Trial: A jury at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) took just five hours to find the couple guilty after the trial . She said: 'I wouldn't do the things they say I did because I've been through it.' The jury was told that cash payments of several hundred pounds a time had been deposited into Omoruyi's account from locations all over the country, including Glasgow, Sheffield and Southampton. He had claimed that money came from his friend. 'I am the kind of person who likes clothes and shoes and I'm known for that - I like to find bargains,' he said. 'It is not that it is any fraud money or anything. My account has not been used for anything like that.' During an interview with police, he said: 'I am here to say I do not even know the people you are talking about - I have never seen them. 'I have never involved myself in that kind of activity in this country, even before this country. I have not and I would not,' he had claimed. Christopher Drew, representing Omoruyi, of London, said: 'Since coming to this country, he has demonstrated a willingness to work honestly.' But Judge Crowther said he was 'certain' that Omoruyi knew the money was illegal and where it was coming from. Idahosa was convicted of a total of eight counts including trafficking two women into and around the UK, inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property. Omoruyi was convicted of two offences of money laundering. A jury at Cardiff Crown Court took just five hours to find them guilty. Both were remanded in custody today to be sentenced next month, but judge Tom Crowther QC warned them they will face lengthy custodial sentences. Speaking after the verdicts had been given, Ms Rees said: 'This was a despicable and callous crime. 'These two defendants were involved in an elaborate deception, taking advantage of cultural and financial issues in order to gain a devastating hold over their vulnerable victims. 'Once the victims had entered the UK, they were exploited and abused in the most brutal manner. Human trafficking is totally unacceptable in our society. 'I hope today's convictions will send a clear message that those who seek to degrade and demean others for their own personal gain can expect to be pursued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. 'It took an immense amount of courage for the victims to come forward and seek to break free from their ordeal. I hope that their courage will act as an inspiration for others who may find themselves in a similar position. 'Whilst we cannot undo what has already happened to these victims, we can hope that today's convictions will help them as they try to move on from their ordeal.' A spokesman for the Home Office, which led the investigation, said: 'Trafficking is an appalling crime that has no place in today's society but, as this case has shown, it is taking place here. 'That is why we are taking action on a number of fronts. 'We are working with law enforcement overseas, the law is being strengthened and the Modern Slavery Bill, one of the first of its kind in the world, will make it easier to prosecute the criminals behind trafficking and improve the protection of victims.'\n",
      "280. Squeezed into a four-bedroom council house in Guernsey lives a woman branded the UK's most prolific single mother. Joanne Watson, 40, has 14 children, ranging in age from three to 22 and . survives largely on state benefits after the breakdown of her marriage . in 2010. Once . celebrated in endless articles in the press for her clan of immaculately . turned-out blonde children, who were then supported entirely by the . salary of her hardworking husband John, Joanne Watson and her family . have now become figures of ridicule - and even hate. Mum of Britain's biggest family Joanne Watson, 40, left, stands at the head of her 14 children at their family home in St Martin, Guernsey: From left to right, Indianna, three; Tallulah, four; Armani (known as Arnie), five; Nerilly-Jade, seven; Lilly-Arna eight; Charlie, nine; Febrianne, 10; Brittany, 11; Caitlin, 12; Georgia, 15; Mariah, 16; Shanice, 19; Bradley, 21; and Natasha 22 . The family's bubble was burst four years ago when an accident meant John, 46, had to give up work as a lorry driver. The . financial pressure of caring for his 14 children meant John made a . decision he will forever regret. As his health improved and with bills . mounting, John claimed benefits while simultaneously taking some . earnings. He was caught, and the man who for . two decades had been seen as the model father was sent to prison. The . couple, who Joanne says had been arguing for years, separated and . divorced. 'I feel pretty sore about what went . on,' John says now. 'I've been married 20 years and been a good father. I've worked hard. Nobody can say I haven't, because I have.' 'I did get done for benefit fraud,' John admits.' But I paid my punishment, I went to prison and I paid all the money back. Joanne leaps to her ex-husband's . defence. 'He wasn't doing it to go on holidays and buy mobile phones,' Jo says. 'He was doing it to support us.' The publicity the case attracted has . made life - one that was already played out in the public eye - yet more . difficult for the Watson children. Georgia, 15, says her regular . appearance in the papers makes life at her school in St Martins very . difficult. Quality time: Joanne relaxes with her 14 children in the garden outside their family home . 'When we're in the papers, everyone . talks about it at school the next day,' she says. 'Last time I was in . the paper everyone was discussing it. People were leaving messages on my . Facebook page. There were over 100 comments and not one of them good. 'A boy at school the next day saw me . and said, \"Oy, what's a Watson doing here?\" I said I'd been here all . along but he said I shouldn't be there because there was too many of us. 'We're only a family. We're like everyone else,' she adds. But Georgia is not entirely like . everyone else. She is a sweet, calm girl with an outlook that is mature . beyond her years. She helps tirelessly at home: planning school uniforms . and packed lunches for the rest of the children, bathing her . three-year-old sister Indianna and putting her to bed. While her home life is no doubt happy . and full of love, she has, perhaps, missed out on some of the carefree . moments that children in smaller families take for granted. Son Bradley, a professional boxer, says the taunts are never-ending. 'If your name is Watson, it doesn't . go down too well,' 21-year-old Bradley says evenly. 'They never say . anything to my face, but your ears are always burning. I don't like it, . but what can you do about it?' But while the children of the . household struggle with life under the microscope, Jo is defiant about . the public's reaction to her and her brood. 'When I was in town this week, a . woman looked at me and said, \"Oh look, it's the baby-making machine.\" I . just glared at her,' Jo adds. 'Sod them all,' she says. 'This is the way I am.' Despite Jo's ability to rise above . the attention though, it's clear that her children despair of their . mother's continual procreation - and of their own cramped (if always . neat and tidy) quarters. 'Our family is huge, laments one of . the littlest boys. There's a new one born nearly every year. Being in a . big family is horrible. If she has any more, that's it, this house won't . fit us.' Indeed, the house is full to . bursting. With 11 children still living at home, getting ready for . school is a military style operation, with little uniformed bodies . filing out of the front door in a seemingly endless line. Packed lunches . are a production line involving bags of fruit and dozens of sandwiches. There are mountains of washing to be done daily - 56 loads a month, to . be precise. Supplies, supplies: Joanne at home with her weekly shopping . Joanne pays only £27 a week rent for . the house, a heavily subsidised fraction of the normal cost, receives a . total of £160 a week in family allowance for the 11 children still . living at home, and another £405 a week in supplementary benefit. But . money is still tight, and a budget must be adhered to. And since her marriage broke down, . with a little help from her children, Jo has to do it all herself. But . despite the workload, Joanne believes firmly that ending her crumbling . marriage was the right thing to do. 'When I was expecting my 14th child, . my husband phoned the papers to tell them so they could arrange a . photoshoot. But I refused to do it. I couldn't go on playing happy . families. It's not right. I couldn't take any more. The way we were . arguing, I didn't want the children to hear it any more.' Since her marriage broke down, Joanne . has been on the look out for a new love - and hasn't given up on the . idea of having another baby. In the hopes of meeting a new man, . Joanne signed up to local dating agencies. But even there she met with . prejudice. One dating agency refused point blank to have her on their . books, saying the men they dealt with wouldn't want someone like Joanne. 'She made me cry,' says Joanne. 'She . said the men wouldn't want someone on state benefits, with so many . children, or living where I live.' But Joanne has developed a thick . skin. Last year, Joanne was left devastated when her pregnancy with what . would be her fifteenth child ended in miscarriage. She had fallen . pregnant just three weeks after embarking upon an affair with leisure . centre worker Craig Le Sauvage, 35, who was an old neighbour. Two weeks later, she split up from . Craig, who subsequently told his story to the papers. Headlines . appeared: \"How I escaped the baby machine\", talking of how Jo bombarded . Craig with texts begging for a fifteenth baby. Joanne was devastated, . but now says that nothing people say about her can match the hurt of . losing the baby she named Billy. Fighting back tears, Jo looks through . a box of scans and tiny foot and handprints from the little boy. 'Holding his little body, seeing his tiny feet and hands. That hurts,' she says. 'People criticising me, slagging me off, that's not hurt.' Joanne's 16-year-old daughter Mariah . recently had her first child - making Joanne four times a grandmother. The media glare this brought upon the family (and their decision to take . part in Channel 4 documentary 15 Kids and Counting, which aired last . night) means the Watsons are unlikely to be out of the headlines any . time soon. But Joanne, who once enjoyed the fame and notoriety her large family brought her, now insists she regrets their infamy. 'I don't want anyone coming to our house looking for a dirty story,' says Joanne. I wish they would just leave us alone.'

Ilg, of Manhattan, New York, is suing a Hustler Club for allegedly charging him nearly $30,000 for alcohol when he was already drunk. He claims to have been so intoxicated on a visit there in May that he was ‘no longer capable of conducting financial transactions’. Lawsuit: W.A. Ilg, of Manhattan, New York, is suing a Hustler Club for allegedly charging him nearly $30,000 for drinks when he was already intoxicated . The club allegedly wrongfully charged $28,109.60 to his credit card, which was ‘far in excess of any reasonable costs’ for the alcohol. Mr Ilg claims the Hustler Club refused to return the money to him after the night out, reported the New York Daily News. The lawsuit said the club has committed ‘a fraud and wrongful conversion upon the plaintiff’ because it would not return the money. Mr Ilg’s lawyer Paul Kerson said in the lawsuit that they are also looking for punitive damages after ‘outrageous’ conduct by the club. Lapdance: Mr Ilg claims to have been so drunk on a visit to the club in May that he was 'no longer capable of conducting financial transactions' (file picture) The lawsuit follows a separate one filed against the same club last year by a Delaware man, who also said he was also falsely billed a huge amount. 'In refusing to return plaintiff's $28,109.60, (the Hustler Club) has committed a fraud and wrongful conversion upon the plaintiff' W. A. Ilg's lawsuit . Gerard Wall claimed to have been charged more than $21,000 on two credit cards even though he only wanted a $300 topless lap-dance. He said he had a huge gap in his memory and woke up the next day in Delaware after being driven home by a club employee. Mr Wall’s case is still pending, reported the New York Post. Neither Mr Kerson or a Hustler Club spokesman have commented on the new lawsuit.\n",
      "282. 'Spider': John Coffey (pictured) was at head of a traveller family which avoided paying taxes and falsely claimed benefits totalling £600,000 . Five members of a traveller family who avoided paying £500,000 in taxes and fraudulently claimed £100,000 in benefits were sentenced today. Husband and wife John and Brigid Coffey, and their children Michael, Mary and Helen were earning millions of pounds from two resurfacing and block paving businesses. While John and Michael Coffey deliberately laundered the money to avoid paying taxes, the female members of the family claimed thousands of pounds in benefits. This was despite the family owning valuable real estate and a number of expensive cars. John Coffey, 49, sat alongside Brigid, 51, Mary, 28, Helen 26, and Michael, 23, at Bristol Crown Court after pleading guilty to 20 tax evasion and other fraud offences between 2001 and 2008. The court heard the family, who lived in South Wales and Gloucestershire, dealt mostly in cash, with John and Michael Coffey only declaring an income of £250 a week between them. During a police interview, John Coffey claimed their money came from block paving, horses and 'general wheeling and dealing'. Judge David Ticehurst jailed John Coffey, whose tax evasion amounted to £450,000, for two years and nine months and was told he must repay the amount in full within 28 days. Michael Coffey, who avoided paying £50,000 in tax, was handed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years. He was also told he would have to repay the money. 'It’s individuals like you that give the travelling community a bad name,' Judge Ticehurst said. 'Criminal conduct like yours brings your community into disrepute and reinforces prejudice. None of us like paying taxes, but society functions on the fact that people pay money to the revenue. 'These taxes are used to fund hospitals, schools, nurses and roads. You, however, choose not to pay tax and to falsely claim benefits of which you were not entitled. 'What is overwhelmingly clear in this case is that each one of you is dishonest. There can be no excuses for your behaviour.' Lavish: The Coffey family's property portfolio included Ton Y Pill farm, which has tall gates and CCTV cameras . Conning the public purse: John Coffey (pictured, left, outside Bristol Crown Court) and his son Michael Coffey (right) laundered money from their paving and resurfacing businesses to avoid paying £500,000 in taxes . The court heard Brigid Coffey claimed £39,789 in benefits, while Helen Coffey claimed £14,544.40 and Mary Coffey a sum of £53,893.44. Brigid Coffey was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months and ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work. Helen Coffey was handed a 12-month prison sentence also suspended for 18 months. She was told to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Mary Coffey was given a suspended sentence of 12 months imprisonment and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Compensation . orders were made in the amounts claimed by Brigid and Helen Coffey . while Judge Ticehurst adjourned making an order against Mary Coffey for . further representations to be made. 'Dishonest': Michael Coffey, pictured carrying a large holdall, was given a suspended prison sentence . Opening the case, Don Tait, prosecuting, said: 'All of the defendants in this case are members of the travelling community, living predominantly in South Wales and Gloucestershire. 'It is the Crown’s case that the family as a whole operated for most of their life on the fringe of society.' The family, who owned two Mercedes, an . Audi and a Mitsubishi pick-up, were able to pass almost £2million . through their 35 bank accounts by using false names and documents. In . one fraudulent house transfer, John Coffey hired two sets of solicitors . and acted the roles of both seller and purchaser simultaneously in . order to transfer property around the family in different names - making . it unclear who owned what. A . number of properties, including two farms in Peterstone Wentlooge, . Cardiff, a £500,000 house in West Drayton, Middlesex, and two houses in . Rumney, Cardiff, were registered to the family. Spared jail: Wife Brigid Coffey, who tried to conceal her identity (right) was given an 12-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming nearly £40,000 in benefits . They lived in Ton Y Pill Farm - a walled property, which boasted high gates and CCTV cameras. But the court heard it was not clear where the funds to buy the properties came from. The family also owned and used two plots at the Mount View Caravan Site in Naas Lane, Brookthorpe, near Gloucester. The properties were mostly paid for by cash or banker’s draft with no mortgages. The family ran two companies, B&B Welsh Paving and Sunset Drives and Landscapes Ltd, which provided driveway resurfacing services. Walked free: Helen Coffey (left) and her sister Mary (right) were given 12-month suspended prison sentences after fraudulently claiming £14,544.40 and £53,893.44 respectively . The latter was set up in 2006 as a front to deliberately conceal the extent of their business revenues, Mr Tait said. But investigations into the family’s bank accounts showed a vast turnover of money. 'The . family appeared to be awash with cash, invested in real estate and . vehicles, yet the female family members were claiming benefits using . subterfuge and non-declaration, said Mr Tait. The . family looked to invest in Spanish properties in the Costa del Sol and . Riviera del Sol, although they never completed on any of their plans to . buy. John Coffey was described by the judge as the 'spider' at the centre of a web of deceit. The court was told his son was just 12 years old when the family fraud began and 17 when he was first arrested in 2007. Addressing . the judge, Raymond Tully, defending Michael Coffey, said: 'It goes . almost without saying you are sentencing a son for crimes committed . together with his father at a time when he was of very tender years.' While the men avoided paying tax, the family women fraudulently claimed £100,000 in benefits. Unwelcome publicity: Helen Coffey, 26, makes an offensive gesture as she hides her face from photographers . The three women told authorities they had no savings or assets and claimed income support, housing and council tax benefit and money from a Social Fund Budgeting Loan. They used a variety of names and stories, on occasion claiming to be single parents who needed the money to buy clothing and footwear. Prithvijit Hoon, defending Brigid Coffey, said: 'One of the ethos of the travel community is the status of the wife being deferential towards her husband.' Christopher Quinlan, mitigating for John Coffey, said: 'Mr Coffey was running a business in respect to which work was done and money was paid. He did not declare that income in terms of tax. 'Mr Coffey is an industrious, hard-working man and the Revenue have got their money through his hard work.' The court heard £500,000 has already been restrained from the family’s bank accounts and is now subject to confiscation proceedings. In 2010 John Coffey and Michael Coffey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulently taking steps to divert money from HM Treasury or to deprive HM Treasury of money to which it was entitled. John Coffey also admitted two counts of knowingly using a false Irish driving licence. Facing justice: Mary Coffey (left) and Brigid Coffey (centre) outside Bristol Crown Court, where they were sentenced . Brigid Coffey pleaded guilty to five counts of making a false statement to obtain benefits, while mother-of-five Mary Coffey pleaded guilty to seven counts of making false statements. Helen Coffey, a mother of one, pleaded guilty in respect of an ongoing claim for income support, failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of her bank accounts with positive balances, and the fact that she was married. She also admitted making a false statement to obtain a Social Fund Budgeting Loan and two counts of providing the false name Helen Delaney to Cardiff Magistrates’ Court in October 2005 and April 2006. Officers from five police forces, HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions worked together to bring the Coffeys to justice. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Shorrock, who led the investigation for Gloucestershire Police, said: 'The sentencing of the Coffey family marks the culmination of many years of work by literally hundreds of officers and officials. Covered up: Defendants John Coffey (left) and Helen Coffey (right) tried to hide their faces outside court . 'This family had been engaging in questionable financial and business activities for many years, until we collectively caught up with them.' Simon De Kayne, assistant director of criminal investigation, HM Revenue and Customs, said: 'The Coffeys blatantly evaded UK tax laws to selfishly steal around £500,000 of taxpayers’ money to fund their criminally gained lifestyles and expanding property portfolio. 'The sentencing shows HMRC, along with our partner agencies, will not only pursue and prosecute tax fraudsters but also seek to reclaim the proceeds of their crimes.' Andrew Biker, of CPS central fraud division, said: 'No income was ever declared by John Coffey to the Inland Revenue despite him working all his life in the tarmac and block paving industries. 'Even more money was made buying and selling cars and trading horses. 'The sheer number of bank accounts operated by the family and their ability to transfer significant funds between them fly in the face of their claims of illiteracy and ignorance of matters such as income tax. 'No matter how you earn money, paying tax matters. But denying the honest British public of their contribution to tax was not enough for the Coffeys who went further by setting out to take funds set aside for those who most need them. 'People can rest assured that the CPS will do all it can to deprive these criminals of their assets and put the money back where it belongs - into the public purse.'\n",
      "283. Detained: Juegers Veloz has been identified as a suspect in a $250 million cell phone cloning scheme . Spanish police have arrested one of America's Most Wanted, believed to be behind a $250 million mobile phone fraud. Juegers Veloz, 37, is accused of being part of a criminal network that stole account information to clone phones which it then sold so users could make fraudulent calls across the world for free. The Dominican national was detained in a call centre on the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca on Thursday, where he'd been living for two years. He was listed among the eight Most Wanted by the U.S. Secret Service - an agency tasked with combating major financial crime which threatens the American economy. Diario de Mallorca reports that the sophisticated fraud was carried out between 2009 and September 2011 in and around the city of New York. Veloz's gang allegedly illegally cloned victim's phones. They are then accused of selling the cloned phones to customers, who paid a regular rental fee for its use. The phone call charges were billed to the original owner. The gang had 12 members, who all carried out different roles. Veloz was allegedly in charge of providing information on the victims and to recruiting new 'clients' to the network. The Spanish Interior Ministry said the owners of the phones were hit with $17million bills, while the gang reportedly netted more than $250million. Five alleged members of the group were arrested in America in February 2012. International arrest warrants were issued for the remaining suspects. Most wanted: Juegers Veloz was among eight people one the U.S. Secret Service's list of highest priority targets . Veloz fled the U.S. to Mallorca, where police got wind of his location last week. They carried out surveillance for several days until 11:30am on Thursday when they arrested him in a call centre. Taken to a police station, Veloz was remanded in custody. He is expected to be extradited to the U.S. in the next week. He faces 20 years in jail if convicted. Veloz's detention eliminates one of the eight most wanted from the U.S. Secret Service's list of major targets. The agency, which is tasked with safeguarding the nation's financial . infrastructure, payment systems and generally presurve the integrity of the . economy from fraud, deals with the biggest suspected fraudsters in the country. Probe: U.S. Secret Service agents are still hunting Dzmitry Burak, left, and James Amthor, right, for their alleged involvement in major fraud crimes committed across America and the world . Among those still at large is Dzmitry Valeryevich Burak, who is accused of being part of an international criminal group that used the internet to traffic in stolen and counterfeit credit cards. According to the agency's website: 'An investigation of Burak's e-mail accounts uncovered more than 55,000 stolen credit card account numbers, which were associated with more than $21 million in actual losses.' Another wanted man is James Paul Amthor. He is accused of being Involved in a fraud scheme costing several banks in Orange County, California $847,575.90. Dominican national Leonardo Bencosme is wanted over a $1million counterfiet credicard scam and is thought to be armed and dangerous. In September 2011, Toni Smith and several co-conspirators stole U.S. Treasury Bonds, with a face value of $268,500, from a victim in Ohio.\n",
      "284. A disgraced property tycoon and a hedge fund trader who cashed in on the credit crunch are both in the New Year Honours list. Ex-convict Gerald Ronson – the great survivor of the Guinness share-trading scandal – is made a CBE. And there is a knighthood for Tory donor Paul Ruddock, who has given more than £500,000 to party coffers since 2003. His firm, Lansdowne Partners, made a staggering £100million from the financial crash by betting that the price of Northern Rock shares would fall and also made millions in a matter of days by predicting the likely slide of other banking shares. Controversial: Ex-convict Gerald Ronson, pictured left with wife Gail, is appointed CBE while Tory donor Paul Ruddock, right, is to be knighted . The honours sparked a cross-party war of words, with Labour accusing . David Cameron of cronyism, but Downing Street insisting that the Prime . Minister had nothing to do with the decisions. Michael Dugher, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: 'David . Cameron promised to clean up politics, but in office he has shown he is . utterly out of touch with decent British people. He is giving a . knighthood to Paul Ruddock, who made millions from the collapse of . Northern Rock and has given over £500,000 to the Tories. 'This tells you everything you need to know about the Tories' priorities. When millions of families are struggling to get by, it's the . Tories' friends in the City who get the rewards.' A member of the Treasury Select Committee, John Mann, described the . knighthood for Mr Ruddock as a 'disgrace'. The Labour MP for Bassetlaw . said: 'The country is sick to death of bankers getting knighthoods from . successive governments. 'It is extraordinary that when there are so many hard working people who . have done a lot for this country, it is people who have caused us so . many problems that are getting awarded. Small business owners who went . under and people who lost their jobs when Northern Rock failed will be . extremely angry.' A Government source stressed that the Prime Minister has no personal . involvement in deciding who receives honours and dismissed any . suggestion of impropriety. The decision, said the source, was taken by . an independent committee in recognition of Mr Ruddock's commitment to . the arts. Donating to a political party is not a bar to an honour but the independent committee is made aware of any donations. Within Government there was anger at Labour's decision to try to make . political capital out of the issue, not least because former Capita boss . Rod Aldridge, who has given Labour £1million, is knighted in today's . list. Jailed: Gerald Ronson, left, during his time inside Ford Prison is the great survivor of the Guinness share-trading scandal . No decision to make: A Government source said that the Prime Minister has no personal involvement in deciding who receives honours . A Government source said: 'This criticism is pretty rich, coming from a . Labour government that gave Fred Goodwin a knighthood – they should wind . their necks in.' Others from the business world whose honours might raise eyebrows . include Denise Coates, founder and chief executive of the online . gambling company bet365. She receives the CBE for services to the . community and business. The daughter of Stoke City FC owner Peter Coates, . she has a £750million fortune and was this year ranked the . eighth-richest woman in the Sunday Times Rich List. Property tycoon and philanthropist Ronson, 72, who was jailed in 1990 . for his part in the Guinness scam, has been honoured for services to . charity. It is rare for a former prisoner to be bestowed with such an . honour. Indeed, one of his co-defendants, the late Jack Lyons, was stripped of . his knighthood after they were convicted along with two other top City . figures. Lyons, who was spared a 30-month term because of his poor . health, was knighted by the 1973 Conservative government and had his title . taken away by John Major. Proud moment: Those people on the New Year Honours list will enjoy a day at Buckingham Palace . Ronson founded Heron Group – now Heron . International Plc – when he was 17, brought self-service petrol stations . to the UK in 1960s and was once the 14th-richest person in Britain and . worth £548million. In 1990 he was, with Lyons, Ernest Saunders and Anthony Parnes, . convicted over Guinness's £2.7billion takeover of the Scottish drinks . group Distillers. The fraud had the effect of boosting the Guinness share price. As it . rose, the group's offer to Distillers' shareholders increased in value, . helping Guinness fend off a bid from rival Argyll and secure the deal. Ronson was convicted of conspiring to create a false market, false . accounting and one of theft. He was fined £5million and sentenced to a . year, but freed after six months for good behaviour. He has always protested his innocence, saying he did not knowingly act dishonestly. A father of four, he is also the uncle of chart-topping musician Mark Ronson. He has raised more than £100million for, and donated more than . £30million to, charities such as the Community Security Trust, NSPCC, . the Prince's Trust and Jewish Care. Asked if Ronson's conviction had any influence over the decision to . award him a CBE, a Cabinet Office spokesman said every nomination for an . honour was considered on its own merits. Other former prisoners to be honoured in the past include footballer . Tony Adams, who was jailed for drink-driving in 1990 and made an MBE 14 . years later. And Mick Jagger was knighted in 2002, 35 years after being . jailed for possessing drugs. The sentence was reduced on appeal to a . conditional discharge. Paul Ruddock, 53, becomes a Knight Bachelor for services to the arts in today's honours list. During the credit crunch in 2007 and 2008 the activities of 'short . sellers' enraged politicians who were trying to shore up plunging bank . shares. Many observers blamed the practice – based on traders selling stock, . allowing the price to fall and then buying it back – for the bailout . funded by taxpayers. Short-sellers were accused of targeting Halifax owner HBOS in particular before it was rescued by Lloyds and then the taxpayer. Mr Ruddock has given £551,598.42 to the Tories since 2003. He is one of . the City's wealthiest men, with a fortune estimated at £280million. Among his philanthropic work, he is chairman of the Victoria and Albert . Museum, for which he has helped raise more than £120million. Delighted: Peter Bazalgette, the man who brought Big Brother to UK screens, has been given a knighthood for services to broadcasting . Peter Bazalgette has the dubious distinction of being the man who brought Big Brother – the epitome of downmarket reality TV – to UK screens. Despite what many will regard as a less than enriching contribution to British life, the media executive has been given a knighthood for services to broadcasting. The 58-year-old was also credited with being instrumental in the rise of lifestyle and make-over shows, having been behind series such as Ground Force, Changing Rooms and Ready Steady Cook. Yesterday Baz, as he is known within the TV industry, said the honour was a ‘delightful compliment’. Bazalgette, great great grandson of civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, oversaw the launch, and several series, of Big Brother for Endemol as well as shows such as Fame Academy, Restoration and Deal Or No Deal. While he did not invent the format for Big Brother he was credited with playing a major part in making the show a success. During his time at the company the reality series was involved in a number of controversies including showing a couple apparently having sex, albeit under the covers, on Teen Big Brother in 2003. Five years ago, in the ‘celebrity’ version of the show, viewers were treated to the dubious privilege of seeing maverick MP George  Galloway dressed in a cat costume and as a vampire, while more recent participants include Sally Bercow, wife of the Commons Speaker. One critic has accused Bazalgette of doing more to ‘debase’ TV over the past decade than anyone else. In recent years he has acted largely as a consultant to the TV industry and for digital media. He has also written about the business of TV formats, with his book Billion Dollar Game published in 2005. Bazalgette said he viewed the award as an acknowledgment of the work of independent TV production firms. After graduating from Cambridge University, Bazalgette joined the BBC’s news trainee scheme,  moving on to become a researcher for That’s Life and then a reporter for Man Alive. Moving behind the cameras, he produced the long-running series Food And Drink before setting up his own company Bazal, later to be absorbed into the Dutch TV giant Endemol. He went on to become Endemol’s chief creative officer, leaving the company in 2007. Bazalgette is president of the Royal Television Society, deputy chairman of English National Opera and the National Film and Television School, and has served on the board of Channel 4. In January this year he was made a non-executive director to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport for his ‘business acumen’ and ‘particular insight into a broad spectrum of media issues’. Another successful TV executive, Paul Smith, the man behind Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, is made a CBE. He was also executive producer of the Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire.\n",
      "285. A convicted fraudster and old friend of the Mayor of London has boasted how he flew 6,000 miles to London to assault a journalist who insulted his wife. Darius Guppy, 49, who has known Boris Johnson since they were students together at Eton and then Oxford, was so enraged by a newspaper article about him that he believed 'humiliated' his wife, Sunderland-born Patricia, he flew from his home in Cape Town to exact revenge. Notoriously vengeful Guppy, who served time in prison for faking a jewel heist, tracked the journalist down to his home, lay in wait for him and then knocked him to the ground as he left the house before tipping a sack of horse manure over him. Darius Guppy, pictured with wife Patricia, sought revenge on a journalist over a perceived insult . In an article boasting about his attack on the man, Guppy - a former friend and Oxford peer of both Boris Johnson and Earl Spencer, wrote: 'I waited for him to emerge from his house, chased him, and then, having knocked him to the ground, emptied over his head a sack of horse manure rendered slurry by the addition of bottled water - a concoction made possible courtesy of Hyde Park Riding School and the springs of Evian. 'The aim had been not to hurt him but to humiliate him as he had sought to humiliate my wife. 'And humiliate him is exactly what I did, in front of his neighbours who had poured out on to the street at the sound of his screams.' Writing in the New Statesman, Guppy said he had two friends with him filming the entire incident, but he says he chose not to put the footage onto the internet as he did not wish to hurt the journalist's family. His article, entitled Who Will Bully The Bullies? names neither the journalist nor the article that upset him, although earlier this year an article appeared in a broadsheet newspaper that cast an aspersion on Mrs Guppy's past. Boris Johnson has said of his old friend that he lives by 'the Homeric code of honour, loyalty and revenge'. Darius Guppy, back row, fourth from right, was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club at Oxford University with Boris Johnson, centre front . In a recent BBC interview with Eddie Mair, the London mayor denied tracking down a tabloid journalist 20 years ago whom Guppy wanted beaten up over probings into him for an article. The affair that the journalist, Stuart Collier, was looking into was the fraud that resulted - eventually - in Guppy going to jail. Guppy and Spencer were best men at each other's weddings - this was at Earl Spencer's wedding to model Victoria Lockwood . Angry with insurers Lloyd's of London after his father lost his home and money in the 1990s financial crisis, Guppy and his fellow Oxford graduate Ben Marsh hired a stooge to tie them up in their room at the Halloran House Hotel in New York and shoot a mattress. When police arrived they convinced them they had been the subject of a jewel heist - Guppy 'sobbing like a baby' for effect. Lloyd's paid up for the 'stolen' jewels within weeks, but the stooge, Peter Risdon, was angry at the small sum he had been paid for his part in the fraud.  Collier started looking into the incident, and Guppy got wind of it. Risdon recorded a conversation between Guppy and Boris Johnson in which they discussed finding the journalist and Guppy said: 'There is nothing I won't do to get my revenge'. In 1993 Guppy was jailed for five years and ordered to pay a £533,000 fine.  Guppy said he had no money and declared himself bankrupt, and was ordered to stay in jail until the fine was paid. But a mystery benefactor lent him £165,000 to get him out jail - a man many suspected was his old friend Charles Spencer.  Guppy was freed in 1996 and moved first to Ireland and then to South Africa. Guppy still lives in South Africa with his wife, with whom he has three children, but has fallen out with his old friend Charles Spencer over unfounded suggestions the latter had tried to seduce his wife. Today there were calls on Twitter for Guppy to be arrested over the alleged assault, but a Met Police spokesman told MailOnline they had not been asked to investigate any such incident.\n",
      "286. As a billionaire playboy, Teddy Sagi revels in his reputation as one of Britain’s most ­eligible and wealthy bachelors. He can certainly boast of ­having had romances with some of the most beautiful women in the world. But what the businessman — who has a ­sprawling home in Knightsbridge — should ­perhaps be less proud of is that he made much of his vast fortune by exploiting the poorest and most ­vulnerable people in the country. Today, a Mail investigation can reveal that he is the king of the fixed-odds betting terminals that have brought such misery to so many — the so-called crack cocaine of the gambling world. Sagi’s company, Playtech, is behind the ­majority of software used by High Street ­bookmakers where people, often from the most deprived areas, pump billions of pounds a year into the machines. Supermodel and the gambling king: Bar Refaeli with Teddy Sagi . Ladbrokes alone took £1 billion on the terminals in just one month as punters addicted to the ‘games’ — which typically ­simulate roulette — wagered up to £100 every 20 seconds on a single spin. As the Mail revealed yesterday, a new poll shows nearly half of all voters believe the terminals should be banned, while 73 per cent want the maximum bet of £100 dramatically reduced. This pernicious presence in ­hundreds of High Streets is a direct result of Labour relaxing gambling regulations in 2001, which opened the floodgates for ­digital roulette games to be played in betting shops. Since then the number of fixed-odds machines has rocketed to 33,000 — with Playtech providing the technology for more than 20,000 of them. They have been blamed for an increase in problem gambling, and are said to have an almost hypnotic effect that leaves players like ‘zombies’. Roger Radler, from Marlow, ­Buckinghamshire, blames his addiction to these machines for him losing his six-figure salary job as a business development manager in London, as well as the collapse of his marriage. He ended up amassing £60,000 of debts, which he kept secret from his wife. At one point he was sleeping on a park bench. ‘You can try for a new “high” every 20 seconds, but then you find you are losing huge sums of money,’ he says. ‘At its worst, I probably lost a month’s salary in a couple of hours. It was horrendous.’ This, then, can be the human cost of the betting machines — yet still Teddy Sagi’s company Playtech ­unashamedly states its software can help book­makers ‘manage your players ­throughout the player’s life-cycle’, describing how a gambler can play on a machine in a betting shop, and then ‘when he is ready to move on, he can continue the game on his smartphone and tablet device in the comfort of his own home’. While it is bad enough that Sagi has helped turn Britain into a nation of gamblers, even more ­disturbing is the fact that he learned some of the tricks of his controversial trade from the world of internet pornography. A fixed odds betting terminal, which are often found in High Street bookmakers . Not only that, I have established he is a convicted criminal who comes from a family with a murderous past. Born in Tel Aviv in 1972, Sagi became accustomed to the finer things in life. His father ran a travel agency and his parents appeared in newspaper ­gossip columns. But he and his ­family were to find far greater notoriety for their criminal activities. In 1983, Sagi’s older stepbrother, Ronen, was convicted of the ­murder of an investment consultant. There was little doubt about his guilt — he stole his father’s gun, fitted a silencer and fired ten bullets at his victim after a disagreement believed to be about money. Then in 1994, when Teddy Sagi was just 22, he was arrested along with seven other businessmen on suspicion of insider trading. They were charged with buying and then manipulating the value of stock in a widespread banking fraud. Sagi, one of the youngest among those arrested, admitted grave deceit, bribery and insider trading. He was jailed for nine months. When he was released, he became hellbent on making his fortune. He teamed up with his father trading on the stock market and buying and selling property. But he realised the internet was the means to make large sums, regardless of the ­morality of how the money is made. As he said in one of his few public statements, ‘sex and betting are the most profitable businesses on the internet’. Sagi invested in companies building pornographic websites. He was also eager to seek out those at the forefront of developing software. In 1999, he invested in a company called Unlimited9, which was involved in setting up ­pornographic sites. That same year, he launched Playtech in a bid to become the ­biggest online gambling ­software developer. He sought out the brightest mathematicians and ­specialists who could develop games that would maximise profits. Just seven years later, the ­company was valued at £550 million when it floated on the London Stock Exchange. Still in his early 30s, Sagi had joined the ranks of the world’s super-rich. Ladbrokes alone took £1billion on betting terminals in just one month (file picture) Since then, the company has gone from strength to strength — two years ago its share price was 312p, but by last month it had soared to 814p. Sagi announced recently that he will sell a 15.4 per cent stake in his company, giving him a payout  of £326 million. Today, he is estimated to be worth more than £1 billion, much of it from his licensing deals for ­gambling software with the likes of William Hill and Ladbrokes. While Sagi does not directly take a cut from gamblers pumping money into the betting machines, he is believed to have considerable financial interests in a number of High Street bookmakers. He certainly knows the importance of ­hiring the best computer geeks to develop his software. Crucially, fixed-odds betting ­terminals are said to be addictive because they tempt the player back with just the right level of rewards. While a gambler may start off ­winning, the odds are likely to be against him in the long term. Also, if someone goes to a casino to play roulette, a single bet can take a few minutes to complete: on a ­roulette game in a High Street ­bookies, it’s over in just 20 seconds. Professor Natasha Dow Schull, a specialist in the way technology is being harnessed by gambling firms, believes the machines made by the likes of Sagi are ‘odious’ and should be banned. Sagi was photographed arm in arm with supermodel Bar Refaeli, pictured in 2009 . ‘The software in these machines taps into a fundamental part of human psychology, exploiting ­people for maximum profit,’ says the American academic and author of a book called Addiction By Design. ‘Essentially, people playing them are being manipulated by mathematicians who have worked out how to up the ante and keep you gambling, with just the right level of reward-to-risk ratio. ‘Sophisticated digital technology and ­mathematics are used to match the way the human brain and our ­psychology work. It makes people addicts.’ Labour MP Tom Watson says: ‘These machines have turned every High Street into a digital casino. They are a menace to communities up and down the country.’ While fixed-odds betting ­terminals have brought financial havoc to many lives, Teddy Sagi has lived high on the profits of his enterprises. Unlike the users of his games, Sagi has received excellent returns on his penchant for risk. ­According to one Israeli newspaper, he ‘likes risk as much as he likes the good life’. Pressure has increased on the Government to take some kind of action to curb the use of betting terminals (file picture) As well as that luxury home in Central London, he has properties in Cyprus, Berlin, Israel and the U.S., and recently splashed out on a Bombardier luxury private jet. When I visited his home in Knightsbridge this week to request an interview, I was told by security staff at the heavily guarded ­complex that Sagi was a ‘very busy and very ­private man’ and was probably away. He did not respond to a letter inviting him to talk to me, nor did his public relations ­representatives return my calls. But he has not been quite so shy when it has come to pursuing some of the world’s most beautiful women. In 2009, he made gossip columns around the world when he was ­photographed arm in arm with the Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli, who had just split up with the Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio. That same year, the couple posed for photographs at an after-show party when he took her to Berlin to watch a concert by Britney Spears. There were also rumours that he was dating Esti Ginzburg, a model who has regularly appeared in a swimsuit in Sports Illustrated  magazine. He had a child, now eight, with a former beauty queen, and is now seeing a former Miss Israel, with whom he’s had a ­second child. But the couple have not ­married and Sagi still gets listed in the media as one of the most ­eligible bachelors around. According to one associate, he revels in his wealth. ‘He likes to have fun. He likes the good life. He takes long holidays and likes to spend his leisure time ­watching football or films. He enjoys playing the piano and ping pong.’ Recently, Sagi raised his profile further in Britain with the purchase of London’s iconic Camden Market for £400 million. Whether gambling machines will continue to be such a cash cow for him remains to be seen, as pressure increases on the Government to take some kind of action to curb their use. But then, thanks to gambling, Teddy Sagi has already played the odds — and is a very big winner indeed.\n",
      "287. The only surviving son of fraudster Bernie Madoff has died after a long battle with lymphoma. Andrew Madoff, 48, was surrounded by family as he 'died peacefully' at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on Wednesday morning, his attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, said in a statement. His death comes four years after his brother Mark killed himself on the second anniversary of their father's arrest for a $65 billion Ponzi scheme. Bernie Madoff is serving an 150-year prison sentence. Andrew Madoff, who leaves behind a fiancée and two daughters, first fought mantle cell lymphoma in 2003 and was diagnosed with the disease again in October 2012. In an interview last year, he blamed the stress of living with his father's arrest for the relapse. Passed: Andrew Madoff, pictured left on the Today show in 2011 and right in February last year, has died of lymphoma. The 48-year-old trader was the last remaining son of fraudster, Bernie Madoff . 'One way to think of this is the scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' Andrew told People magazine in April 2013. 'And it's killing me slowly.' As part of his treatment, he had a stem cell transplant in May 2013, followed by chemotherapy. Although he reconciled with his mother, Ruth, shortly before his second diagnosis, he always said that he had no interest in having contact with his father. 'Even on my deathbed, I will never forgive him for what he did,' he told People magazine. 'He's already dead to me.' Before the storm: Andrew Madoff is pictured second right with his father Bernie, brother Mark and mom Ruth . Locked up: Madoff, pictured in January 2009, is serving an 150-year sentence in a North Carolina prison for his $65 billion Ponzi scheme. Andrew Madoff said he would never forgive his father for what he did . Bernie Madoff was arrested on December 11, 2008, following his $65 billion Ponzi scheme, which became the largest financial fraud in history. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009. The charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC. The scheme was exposed after he told his sons about it and they contacted the FBI. Andrew told People magazine last year that turning his father in was 'at the same time the easiest decision I ever had to make and the hardest'. Andrew, who had been head of equities at his father's New York-based company, always denied knowing anything about the scheme. Family man: Andrew Madoff is pictured with his daughters, Anne and Emily, from his first marriage . Left behind: A photo from 2011 shows Andrew Madoff with his fiancee Catherine Hooper and his mother Ruth. He reconciled with his mother after initially shunning her but said he would never forgive his father . Struggling to deal with the revelations, Mark Madoff, 46, hanged himself in his apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, as his two-year-old son was asleep in the room next door. Speaking on the Today show in 2011, Ruth Madoff revealed that the last time she had seen her son Mark alive was the evening her husband had revealed the scheme. 'I'll never get over that,' she said. 'I blame Bernie. It's the worst thing that can happen,' In January, Bernie Madoff revealed he was battling his own health woes, telling CNBC that he suffered a heart attack last year and had been diagnosed with kidney cancer. Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies. No family members were criminally charged. Torn apart: Madoff's other son, Mark, is pictured with his wife Stephanie ahead of his suicide. He committed suicide in December 2010 on the second anniversary of their father's arrest . Scene: A police officers points to the third floor New York City apartment where Mark Madoff's body was found after he hanged himself. He took his life as his two-year-old son slept in the room next door . Mantle cell lymphoma, which most often affects men over the age of 60, is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that causes white blood cells to grow and multiply uncontrollably. It is aggressive and often comes back after patients go into remission. Survival rates are generally poor compared to other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and most people do not live longer than five years after diagnosis. Initial symptoms can include fever, heavy night sweats and weight loss. Patients may also find a lump on their neck, armpits or groin. Andrew Madoff leaves behind two daughters, Anne and Emily, from his first marriage. He was engaged to Catherine Hooper.\n",
      "288. Britain's biggest bank HSBC has been dragged into yet another potential scandal over claims  that it set up offshore accounts in Jersey for suspected drug-dealers and fraudsters. HM Revenue & Customs launched an investigation after a whistleblower leaked details of £700million allegedly held in more than 4,000 accounts hidden in the island tax haven. Many of the account-holders are now being probed for tax evasion, while HSBC could face sanctions from regulators if it is found not to have flagged up suspicious deposits to the Jersey authorities. Scandal: HSBC is accused of setting up thousands of accounts in Jersey for clients that include drugs and arms dealers . The latest revelations come just . months after it emerged that HSBC allowed rogue states and drug cartels . to launder billions of pounds through subsidiaries in the US and Mexico. It is expected to face fines of up to £1billion over the affair. Tax accountant Richard Murphy, a . long-time campaigner against Jersey’s tax haven status, said the leaked . HSBC accounts could be the tip of the iceberg, claiming: ‘I don’t see . any reason why HSBC is worse than any other bank in Jersey.’ But he added of HSBC: ‘This bank was . clearly out of control. It confirms what we’ve begun to realise, that . this is a bank that was, during the period that the Reverend Lord . Stephen Green was in charge, the world’s biggest money-launderer.’ Former chairman Lord Green, an ordained priest in the Church of England, is now a trade minister in the Coalition government. Idyllic: Jersey serves as a tax haven where thousands of HSBC customers have their cash. James Blunt is alleged to have deposited more than £2 million in an account there . Those whose account details were . leaked to HMRC are said to include Daniel Bayes, a suspected drug-dealer . now living in Venezuela. Mr Bayes refused to return from South America, . allowing his father, Brian Bayes, to be tried and convicted alone after . police found £500,000 of cannabis at his farm in 2006. HSBC was founded as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865 to help finance trade links between Europe, India and China. The inspiration came from Scot Thomas Sutherland, who worked for shipping giant P&O and saw the demand in Far East banking facilities. It began building up branches in Asia and printed Thailand's first banknotes after being the first bank to open there in 1888. Recession and political turmoil in the 1930s caused uncertainty and most of the bank's staff became prisoners of the Japanese during the Second World War. But out of the ashes it rebuilt itself on large reserves built up in peace time and was central to rebuilding Hong Kong's economy. In the 1970s it began to focus more on strategies for the UK, buying Midland Bank in 1992 and then making them HSBC in 1999 with a huge re-branding. As the world's second largest bank it serves around 89 million customers in 85 countries  and territories with 7,200 offices and branches worldwide. The list also includes a man convicted . of owning 300 weapons at a property in Devon, three bankers facing . fraud allegations, and a man known as London’s ‘number two computer . crook’, according to the Daily Telegraph. While most of the accounts are held by . rich City bankers and professionals, others were said to have been . opened by people with no obvious legal source of wealth. John Harris, Jersey’s chief of . financial regulation, said he would ‘robustly’ investigate whether rules . had been breached but said tax evasion was ‘ultimately a police . matter’. He insisted that Jersey co-operates . with other nations but said it had no plans to adopt the system used by . most European countries, who automatically pass on financial data about . non-residents to their home tax authority. But Mr Murphy said: ‘What’s the only . reason to offer someone the chance not to tell the tax authorities what . they’re earning? It’s because you know the person you’re dealing with is . a tax evader.’ HSBC said of the leaked list: ‘We are . investigating the reports of an alleged loss of certain client data in . Jersey as a matter of urgency. ‘We have not been notified of any . investigation in relation to this matter by HMRC or any other authority . but, should we receive notification, we will co-operate fully with the . authorities. HSBC remains fully committed to adoption of the highest . global standards including the procedures for the acceptance of . clients.’ HMRC said: ‘We can confirm we have . received the data and we  are studying it. Where we uncover evidence of . tax evasion we will crack down on it.’ Under-fire: HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver is under huge pressure to clean up his bank's act after scandals at home and abroad .\n",
      "289. Lionel Messi is to face a court trial for alleged tax evasion after a judge rejected the Barcelona star's appeal in Spain. The  four-time Ballon d'Or winner and his father, Jorge Messi, are accused of withholding about £3.4million in unpaid taxes between 2007 and 2009. The Spanish judge's statement read: 'In this type of crime, it is not necessary for someone to have complete knowledge of all the accounting and business operations nor the exact quantity, rather it is sufficient to be aware of the designs to commit fraud and consent to them.'

Messi, the Barcelona maestro, will face a court trial for alleged tax evasion in Spain after his appeal fails . Messi had hoped to avoid having to appear in court because his father manages his income. Now he must sit in the dock alongside his father and answer questions relating the failure to pay tax in Spain between 2007-09 on various sponsorship deals, by diverting revenue through companies in England, Switzerland and Uruguay. In July, Spain's public prosecutor recommended charges be dismissed against the 27-year-old, arguing Messi was not responsible for his family's finances, as that was his father's duty. If a court decides that he was party to the wilful avoidance of tax he will face a large fine and could even face a suspended prison sentence. Messi made a payment of about £8m to the Spanish tax man last year to head off further problems relating to years tax 2010 and 2011, and paid the £10.2m owed on his image rights and the £9.4m owed on his salary on time for the last tax year.

Messi and his father, who manages his financial affairs and acts as a representative, have five days to appeal the ruling. They both deny the allegations. It is reported that Messi's income at Barcelona is about £12.5m per year, although that does not include any sponsorship endorsements.

      "290. Adewale Adewole admitted to using Match.com to con four women out of nearly £100,000 . A lonely hearts conman who scammed four women out of almost £100,000 by posing as a Royal Marine on dating website Match.com has been jailed for four years . Adewale Adewole, 31, a Nigerian immigrant, wooed his victims after falsely claiming to be an army captain who ran an orphanage in Africa. Adopting the name Timmy Francis, he claimed he was looking for romance on the site with two profiles: 'Charismatic Brit' and 'To live and love'. But the pictures he used to create an appealing profile were actually of a Royal Marine Commando called Joshua McGowan who was unaware his images were being used by Adewole. The unnamed women who replied to his seemingly perfect profile fell for his charms but were then duped out of their money when Adewole claimed he was robbed at his 'orphanage'. The women sent him cash and paid his hotel bills thinking they were bailing out their suitor - only for him to divert the money into the bank account of his wife who shared his home with their two children in Eccles, Greater Manchester. Manchester Crown Court heard yesterday that Adewole, a father of three, also splashed out on iPads, TVs and designer clothes. Police who investigated the scam discovered the women had tried to meet up with him but he always stood them up. He now faces jail after admitting four charges of fraud but is disputing some of the facts and is running a 'trial of issue.' Prosecutor Charlotte Brandon told the court the four victims were registered with Match.com and did not know each other. She added: 'They were all contacted on the dating site by a man called Timmy Francis who had two profiles under the mottos 'To Live and Love' and 'Charismatic Brit'. 'They had contact with him during the period the fraud took place via text message, phone and email. 'He told them he had been a captain in the army. He also said he ran an orphanage in Africa called the Hope House Foundation, for which he set up a website with his own mobile phone number on. Manchester Crown Court heard Adewole, from Eccles in Greater Manchester, diverted the money from the unnamed into his wife's account . 'There was a profile picture on his Match accounts and he sent some of the women photographs of himself - all of these pictures were actually of a Royal Marine Commander called Joshua McGowan who knew nothing of what was going on. 'Each of the women wanted to find out more about him and were led to believe they were in a relationship with him. 'Although they arranged to meet, he never kept to the arrangements and never did meet any of the victims.' Miss Brandon added: 'He told the women that on a trip to Africa he was the victim of a crime and needed money. The crime meant he could not access his own funds. 'He said they would get their money back and would be sent letters from the World Health Organisation to show that he would be able to pay them. 'These letters were sent, but from an M30 Manchester postmark. He also sent them links to websites which, when logging in with details he gave them, appeared to show that he had a huge bank balance and would eventually be able to pay them back. 'One woman was asked to pay for a hotel for him. When she rang the number he gave her for the hotel, they also confirmed the information and she agreed to pay it. 'She later received a cheque addressed to him for £35,000 to prove he had money, but this was later discovered to be a stolen cheque forged in his own handwriting. 'Over a number of months each woman transferred significant sums of money via bank accounts and Western Union moneygrams and sent items to the defendant's home address. They bought electronic items, took out credit cards and loans and bought clothes from Next. Adewole used a Royal Marine called Joshua McGowan's Facebook pictures to create a seemingly perfect Match.com profile to attract women . 'Many of the goods were sent to his home address in Eccles from where the victims believed they would be forwarded on to the defendant in Nigeria. 'When the women stopped sending money, they never heard from him again.' The court heard the total amount stolen including the value of the household goods and Western Union transfers was £98,140. Adewole was arrested in October 2012 at his flat and £4,500 in cash was found under his bed. A digital camera was found purchased by one of the victims, but containing pictures of the defendant and his wife and children. Designer clothes and shoes were also found worth £2,000. Adewole's wallet was also seized and contained several SIM cards, some of which contained the phone numbers of the victims. His two Blackberry phones were also seized - on these three different email accounts were in use which were linked to the two Match.com accounts. He was bailed and later tried to call one of the woman again under the name Timmy Francis and was arrested again. When questioned he claimed to know nothing of the orphanage but that the £4,500 was his and claimed the majority of the items found in his flat were to go to his mother in Nigeria. He added all he knew of the bank transfers was that his flatmate Samson Ajayi had asked him to have some money transferred to a relative - and claimed Mr Ajayi was responsible. He admitted he had used Match.com between 2010 and 2012 but could not remember when exactly. Detective Constable Sean Nicholls, from Greater Manchester Police, told the hearing: 'There has never been any evidence to prove there was someone else involved. 'There was possibly some help involved somewhere in Nigeria. There may well have been more than one person assisting him, male and female. 'But I believe any phone calls made to the victims were from the defendant himself. 'I believe Timmy Francis is a made-up name. I have made enquiries in our systems but there is nothing to suggest he exists.' Adewole, who arrived in UK in 2009 on a visa to study, said: 'The fraud was Samson's idea. I got involved because I had a few financial difficulties at the time. 'I did not speak with the complainants. I did not know money was being sent to Nigeria but I knew it was being sent to my bank account and my wife's bank account. 'I do not know where Samson is at the moment. He travels a lot. I have no idea about the details of this fraud. I didn't even know how many victims there were. 'But I pleaded guilty because if I had not let my bank account or flat be used, these women would not have suffered in the way that they did. 'Samson said he was expecting some money. He said he had no bank accounts to receive the money so I wanted to help him. He was owing me rent at the time and this was the only way he could pay me. ' Sentencing Adewole today, Judge David Stockdale said: 'The evidence against the defendant is, in my judgement, overwhelming. 'I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard of the facts that the defendant's role in the enterprise in which these four women were defrauded was a leading role. 'He was not working alone and others were involved but the use of his bank account and phones and the items found at his flat all indicate overwhelmingly that the defendant was a principle player. 'The man called Samson has not been traced. He may have been an accomplice.. If Samson was an accomplice and took part in this operation, that does not undermine my conclusion. That is my ruling on the issue.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
      "291. A broke former footballer who masqueraded as Chelsea player Gael Kakuta in order to fund a luxury lifestyle of champagne, women, fast cars and shopping sprees was jailed for four years today. Medi Abalimba, 24, was once a promising star, earning up to £4,000 a weeks and was once s old to Derby County for £1.2million and. But his career bombed after he struggled to recover from an injury. Unwilling to give up his celebrity life, he began breaking into lockers at the private health club in Camden where he was a member, in order to steal credit card details. He would then go on spending sprees in luxury shops, five-star hotels and trendy nightclubs pretending to be Kakuta, while using the card details to pay. Medi Abalimba, 24 (left), has been jailed for four years after duping bars, restaurants, luxury stores and five-star hotels out of thousands of pounds by pretending to be Chelsea player Gael Kakuta . During one incident he duped starstruck staff into running up a £25,000 bar tab on Cristal champagne in one London club  claiming 'he was a Premier League star and good for the money.' He also ran up a £12,000 bill at three luxury London hotels, took a bar in Manchester for another £5,000, scrounged suites in luxury apartment complexes and spent £11,000 on limousines. On another occasion he took four star-struck girls from Manchester on a £1,100 helicopter tour over London before having them stay with him at an £800-a-night rented mansion in Berkshire, which he falsely claimed was his home. He also used another woman’s credit cards to rack up a £4,633 bill at a spa and to hire a Range Rover at a cost of £2,397. Abalimba took four girls on a £1,100 helicopter ride over London, before inviting them back to a £800-a-night mansion in Berkshire, saying it was his home . Abalimba was caught after he attempted to buy clothing worth more than £20,000 from Selfridge's at the Trafford Centre near Manchester - even practising his football skills inside while browsing. After being arrested, he claimed his one-time massive weekly wage left him with a 'wholly unrealistic' understanding of money. Abalimba was born in the Congo and had begun his career as a midfielder in the youth teams of Crystal Palace and Fulham, before moving to Southend United where he was paid £1,000 a week at just 16 years old. He attracted attention from several Premier League clubs early in his career and was given trials at Manchester United and Manchester City. At Liverpool, he played for the reserves while the then manager Rafa Benitez watched from the stands and eventually signed for Derby County in 2009 for £1.2million. He was paid £4,000 a week and received an appearance fee of £1,000 as a substitute, and £2,000 for starting a match. But his career was curtailed by injury and he was sent to Oldham Athletic on a free transfer in January 2011 having failed to make a competitive appearance. In August 2012 he was signed by Farnborough Town with a wage of just £300 a week and was forced to supplement his income with part-time work as a taxi firm controller. Fearing his friends would dump him, he turned to fraud in order to keep up the illusion of wealth. He called venues in advance, pretending to be Kakuta’s agent and advising them of his imminent arrival before using 'compromised' credit cards to pay for goods and services. He took friends for a night out in London where he duped staff at the Cirque du Soir burlesque club in Soho into giving him champagne after convincing them he had put his credit card behind the bar. When a waiter could not find the card, Abalimba said he was a Premier League footballer and showed the server photos of himself posing in football shirts with Premier League stars. He then racked up the five-figure bar tab entertaining a table of 10 guests, buying bottles of champagne which cost up to £5,000 each - even offering to buy bubbly for a man at the next table. In all he ordered two jeroboams of Cristal, each equivalent to four regular bottles, and used a microphone to invite the entire club back to his house for a party. The failed footballer ran up a bill of £8,000 in the acclaimed Gilgamesh Bar and Lounge (pictured), treating 20 of his friends to dinner . Mandarin hotel in London was also conned out of £3,000 by Abalimba, who pretended to be Gael Kakuta while using stolen credit card details . At the end of the night, it was discovered he could not pay the bill and police arrived to arrest him. At the time he claimed he had been given a credit card by his French football club but was given a six-month suspended sentence. Just months later he phoned a trendy club in Manchester and put on an American accent, pretended to be the agent for Gael Kakuta and asked for a table. The Corinthia hotel was left £7,000 out of pocket by Abalimba, who cannot repay any of his debts because the court heard he has nothing left . Throughout the the evening he posed as Kakuta to order champagne worth £2,600. At the end of the night claimed he had left his wallet in a limousine and told staff he had his credit card details over the phone. The payment, made using stolen credit card details, was authorised and Abalimba then pre-paid more than £2,000, telling staff he would return. The next night he drank champagne with friends before leaving in a chauffeur driven Bentley GT. Last July Abalimba went to Selfridges in the Trafford Centre where he chose more than £20,000 worth of clothing only to claim he could not pay with his credit card as it had been damaged. He later phoned the store to try and make a payment over the phone using the stolen credit card details. But just as a chauffeur was sent to collect the goods, a store detective became suspicious and withheld the items. Police traced Abalimba to a mansion where he had been staying and he later told police he regularly broke into lockers at a sports club in Camden using master keys,  and used his phone to photograph members’ credit card details. It emerged that in London he ran up huge bills during hotel stays, including £7,000 at the Corinthia hotel, £3,000 at Mandarin, £2,000 at Millennium Hotel and £1,400 at Bulgari Hotel. Officers found his fingerprints on a pair of Harvey Nichols shoes the fraudster had attempted to give out as a tip. He also enjoyed drinks at several nightclubs and restaurants including the acclaimed Gilgamesh, run by head chef Ian Pengelley, where he ran up a bill of £8,000 for 20 of his friends. In Manchester he deceived hotels including Park Inn, Worsley Marriott and the Great John St Hotel. He also attempted to book £4,206 worth of rooms at The Midland but was thwarted by extra security checks by staff there. He also tried to fraudulently obtain a £9,000 Rolex watch from a jeweller. On one of his many trips to London, Abalimba spent £2,000 at Millennium Hotel (left and right) on phony cards . At Manchester Crown Court, Abalimba, who is currently living in west London admitted three charges of fraud, taking a Range Rover without consent and making off without paying for £104 worth of petrol and asked for 19 other offences to be considered. After the case Sgt Adam Cronshaw of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Having spoken with many of the victims in this case it appears that Abalimba is a charming and charismatic individual who was able to call on his previous football experience and the fact he bears some resemblance to the real Gael Kakuta to deceive them. 'He was able to trick most people he came across and grew in confidence the longer the charade continued. He became so skilled in lies and deceit that his character went from being plausible to unquestionable. Abalimba was caught after trying to buy £20,000 worth of goods at Selfridges in the Trafford Centre (pictured) Abalimba gave the store his card details over the phone, but just as a chauffeur was sent to collect the items, store security became suspicious and withheld the items . 'Abalimba told us that many of his victims treated him so differently because they thought he was a celebrity footballer. Unfortunately this trust and goodwill was misplaced. 'While I have some sympathy for the way his career was curtailed, there can be no excuses for the persistent and deliberate frauds that have left numerous people and businesses out of pocket. 'I’m glad we were able to catch him and prevent further loss to other potential victims as he showed no signs of halting his activity. 'I hope more businesses are now aware of this scam and have the necessary security measures in place to prevent similar occurrences.' Police said the latest frauds totalled £163,000 but with no assets or cash to his name there is no opportunity for financial compensation to be paid to victims. Abalimba once ran up a £25,000 bar tab in a London club, buying two jeroboams of Cristal champagne, telling bar staff he was 'good for the money (pictured, Abalimba is arrested)\n",
      "292. The world’s biggest accountancy firm Deloitte, powerfulbanks Credit Suisse and Chase Manhattan, and giant law firm Richards Butler, now part of Reed Smith –which represented Gordon Brown at the Leveson Inquiry – are all on a secret list belonging to a corrupt private detective. A Mail on Sunday investigation has also established the rogue investigators jailed last year for illegally accessing information by ‘blagging’ appeared to be linked to international solicitors’ firms Herbert Smith –which represented former RBS boss Fred Goodwin – and Clyde & Co. Last night a senior Westminster source . indicated that all six firms are on the classified Serious . Organised Crime Agency list currently locked away in a safe opposite . theHouse of Commons. ‘Blagging’ is defined as obtaining information without consent. But The Mail on Sunday has also uncovered new SOCA evidence often further blue-chip firms – whose names were recorded by one of the detectives – including Manchester United sponsor and insurance giant AON, and Jyske, a Danish bank. The evidence we have seen shows that SOCA were aware of the names of the companies five years ago. MPs have demanded that the companies’ names are made public. There is no evidence that those named knowingly employed the rogue detectives in criminal activity on their behalf. It is unclear whether the other names also appear on the list passed to MPs. We can also reveal that Morgan Sindall, a construction company with multi-million-pound Government contracts and Greymans, a bespoke security firm specialising in work for celebrities, were both linked to the detectives in cases which resulted in prosecutions. The list came to light two months ago. SOCA handed the secret list of 102 over to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee . Our revelations last night led to calls for the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry to be widened beyond the media so that it includes the use of private eyes to perform illegal acts by any clients. The controversial SOCA list of 102 customers was handed over amid great secrecy to MPs on the Home Affairs Committee last month. The existence of the clandestine list . emerged two months ago. Since then there have been repeated calls for . the agency dubbed ‘Britain’s FBI’ to name the companies. But . SOCA’s former chairman Sir Ian Andrews – who resigned over a conflict . of interest last month – prevented publication of the names as it could . ‘substantially undermine the financial viability of major organisations . by tainting them with public association with criminality’. Last . week Trevor Pearce, SOCA director general, said: ‘I repeat the point we . are not alleging that the individuals or companies named on the list . have or even may have committed a criminal offence.’ Today this newspaper is listing the names of companies and individuals who are linked to the convicted detectives. Our enquiries into the SOCA files revealed: . There is no evidence that the company was aware of the illegal activity. SOCA’s investigation into private eyes, called Operation Millipede, began in 2008 when infamous blagger Daniel Summers, 34 – already under surveillance – advertised an iMac computer for sale from his home in Kingston-upon-Thames. Undercover officers bought the computer for £590 and, after forensic examination, retrieved a number of files which Summers had sought to destroy. This led police to four other private investigators, three of whom, along with Summers, were convicted of fraud for their part in the blagging of information on a number of victims in 2007 and 2008. When arrested in May 2009, Summers told officers: ‘I know why you are here, this is massive. I’m in the biggest s**t imaginable. ‘Do you want me to talk now? I’ll sing like a canary.’ Summers, described as the ‘lynchpin’ along with former policeman John Spears, Graham Freeman and one other man who cannot be named for legal reasons, were all jailed at Kingston Crown Court last year. After the case, SOCA tried to justify why they had only investigated the private eyes rather than any third parties by saying: ‘In recognition of the fact the operation might also uncover information relevant to other authorities, SOCA worked in partnership with a number of bodies including [data protection watchdog] the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). SOCA will now hand over any such information to its partners to determine whether further action is appropriate.’ But the ICO has still not been handed the information discovered during the Millipede investigation. SOCA said they decided to make it available first to the Metropolitan Police’s Operation Tuleta team, an ongoing investigation into computer hacking, primarily by journalists. But last week it emerged that while some evidence on the Millipede had been passed over to the Scotland Yard team, it was not until three weeks ago that Met Commander Neil Basu was handed an official list showing customers organised into business sectors. SOCA’s decision to block publication came as the newspaper industry was targeted in the phone-hacking inquiry, which led to widespread public revulsion and the largest criminal investigation in British history over practices which include the hiring of corrupt private eyes. In light of the revelations, there have been calls for Lord Justice Leveson's hacking inquiry to look beyond the media . Even lawyer Mark Lewis, representing the family of hacked murder victim Milly Dowler and a scourge of the tabloids, has said: ‘Consistency demands that the same rules apply to all, whether you run a newspaper, a pharmaceutical company or a law firm.’ Documents uncovered in our investigations suggest that in 2008 major tunnelling contractor Morgan Sindall investigated three of its own employees suspected of taking ‘kickbacks.’ Some of the work was carried out by Dan Summers. As with many of the cases, there was a complicated chain of command involving companies hiring private detectives who might subcontract work to other private detectives who may not be so scrupulous in their methods. Last year a private investigator who was arrested and later cleared in the ‘blagging’ case took Morgan Sindall to an employment tribunal claiming he had been promised a job in return for keeping the company’s name out of the inquiry. His case was thrown out, but during the hearing the company’s lawyers revealed that around September 2009 the firm was ‘advised by solicitors that it faced no charges and indeed that at no stage did it fear criminal prosecution’. A spokesperson said: ‘Morgan Sindall Group takes issues of fraud and misconduct very seriously and operates a whistleblowing system through which individuals can register any concerns. All such investigations are conducted properly and within the confines of the law.’ Greymans, now called Optimal Risk, is one of the companies mentioned in Spears’s files. Greymans specialises in handling problems and security issues for celebrities and wealthy individuals discreetly. Founded by Falklands veteran and ex-Parachute Regiment Major Mike O’Neill, 56, it was formed in 1993 and boasts of clients including multinationals, finance houses and law firms. Our files show that the company used the services of the corrupt detectives on numerous occasions, and a trail of emails prove it often directly engaged Summers – usually through its former financial controller, Andy Driver, who died of alcohol poisoning in 2011. Mr O’Neill failed to answer our calls or emails last week, but former operations director and ex-Met Special Branch officer Christopher Cully, who left the firm three years ago, yesterday denied that Greymans had engaged Summers. Another company linked to the case is Keltbray PLC. The large rail contractor does not appear on the SOCA list itself, but it is closely linked to a firm which does: Gamble Rail. Deloitte- the world's biggest accountancy firm- was one of the names on the top secret list . Keltbray is a specialist demolition and civil engineering contractor recently awarded a £46 million contract to build power infrastructure alongside the West Coast Main line for Network Rail. Since 2008, Keltbray has donated £63,500 to the Conservative Party and a further £20,000 to Dr Liam Fox MP, according to the Electoral Commission. We have seen a fax sent in July 2008, by chartered accountant Michael Bilton, 59, a director of Gamble Rail, giving the bank account numbers of a business rival he wanted to be examined and ended with: ‘Requirement: Special investigation on his personal and business bank accounts.’ In 2009 Gamble went into liquidation and was taken over by Keltbray, and Bilton became finance director at one of the group’s companies, Keltbray Aspire Rail. Contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Bilton said he had never been asked about the fax by SOCA or any other police officers, but admitted sending it. ‘It’s not something I’ve ever done before or since. At that time, I wasn’t asking anything illegal to be done. I didn’t know what someone could or couldn’t get through legal means,’ he said. When we asked him, as a chartered accountant, whether he knew of any legal means to investigate an individual’s personal bank account without his consent, he replied: ‘I assumed – obviously wrongly – that it would be done by fair means, not foul means. I just hadn’t thought it through.’ A spokesman for Keltbray said: ‘We would, of course, prefer if you did not refer to Keltbray in your article, given that the events you refer to date back to 2008 when Mr Bilton was not employed by Keltbray. He was employed by us from 2009 to 2012, and as a director of the rail division only in the last two of these years – from 2010 until 2012.’\n",
      "293. The Harvard Business School instructor who blasted a Boston-area Chinese restaurant for overcharging him by $4 on a takeout order has apologized. Associate professor Benjamin Edelman complained to the owners the of Sichuan Garden in Brookline after he was charged $1 more on each of the four items he ordered for takeout recently. Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owner, acknowledged the prices listed on its website were out of date and promised to update them soon. Angry emailer: Ben Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard, has unleashed a string of angry and threatening emails to Sichuan Garden, claiming they overcharged him $4 and it was illegal . But Edelman demanded a $12 refund, citing state law. He also contacted local officials to demand the restaurant compensate all other customers who might have been affected. On Tuesday, Edelman posted a message on his personal website admitting that his lengthy emails with Duan were 'out of line' and that he has reached out to the restaurant to apologize. 'Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it’s clear that I was very much out of line,' wrote Edelman on his website. 'I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future.' EdeIman said he had also reached out to the owner to apologize to him personally as well. Duan said he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from people as far afield as Australia offering donations and support with his website and legal advice. Apologetic: Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owners who manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, responded to Edelman in a courteous way . 'I just want to make clear that we are not a business in financial distress. We have been blessed with the support of our amazing community and hospitality family that has understood the value of a hard working family. Your support and kind words are more then enough,' he wrote. Duan said he had also increased an increase in business as a result of the publicity that the story had generated and that he had received 'overwhelming' support from Harvard graduates and the student body. 'I believe that one man’s actions should not be the burden of another. I just want to apologize to Harvard for all the negative association they have been linked with this ordeal. I also believe that something good can come out of all this situation,' he wrote. Duan manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, a Chinese restaurant founded by his parents and appeared in a recent issue of GQ hailed as 'America's Most Imaginative Bartender'. The incident began on Friday when Edelman ordered $53.53 worth of takeout from the restaurant and was shocked when the bill was $4 more than he had added up using the online menu. He emailed the restaurant, who admitted that their website was 'out of date' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $1, causing the Harvard Business School professor to send a barrage of threatening emails that were made public by Boston.com. Scene: Edelman had ordered takeout from the Sichuan Garden in Brookline (pictured) 'Under Massachusetts law it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price,' Edelman wrote. 'I urge you to cease this practice immediately. 'In the interim, I suggest that Sichuan Garden refund me three times the amount of the overcharge. 'The tripling reflects the approach provided under the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL 93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations. 'Please refund the $12 to my credit card. Or you could mail a check for $12 to my home.' Edelman recieved an apologetic reply about an hour later from Duan. 'We are a mom and pop restaurant and we pride ourselves on hard work and authentic Sichuan cuisine,' Duan wrote. 'I will honor the website price and honor you the $3.00.' However this only seemed to infuriate Edelman further. Not happy: After initally going to great lengths to get the restaurant to credit him $12 over the so-called mishap, Edelman has now apologized profusely for his bullying behavior . 'It strikes me that merely providing a refund to a single customer would be an extremely light sanction for the violation that has occurred,' Edelman wrote back. 'To wit, your restaurant overcharged all customers who viewed the website and placed a telephone order – the standard and typical way to order takeout. 'You did so knowingly, knowing that your website was out of date. 'You don't seem to recognize that this is a legal matter and calls for a more thoughtful and far-reaching resolution. 'Nor do you recognize the principle, well established in applicable laws, that when a business intentionally overcharges a customer, the business should suffer a penalty larger than the amount of the overcharge.' Duan responded with an obvious question: 'You seem like a smart man. But is this really worth your time?' Again, Edelman came back firing. 'You're right that I have better things to do,' Edelman's replied. Popular: Duan was featured in GQ magazine last month and hailed as 'America's most imaginative bartender' 'If you had responded appropriately to my initial message – providing the refund I requested with a genuine and forthright apology – that could have been the end of it. 'The more you try to claim your restaurant was not at fault, the more determined I am to seek a greater sanction against you.' Edelman 'passed the matter on to the authorities' in Brookline. Duan wrote back: 'Once again thank you for bringing it to my attention, I will wait for proper authorities to direct me on how to resolve this situation. 'Once they direct me on how to resolve this situation with you, we will be able to honor the price that they advise me on. 'I will make a note that you seek out 50 percent off your total meal bill. 'I have no issues with honoring 50 percent off your total bill if the authorities see fit. 'I hope you understand I want to go through the proper channels so we can resolve this properly. 'I will keep you updated as soon as they contact me.' According to Boston.com, besides Harvard, Edelman also operates a consulting practice that works at 'preventing and detecting online fraud (especially advertising fraud)'. His clients include Microsoft, the NFL, the New York Times, and Universal Music. Edelman sent a statement to Business Insider saying he believes how he handled the situation with Sichuan Garden was helping other people as well. 'We all rely on trust in our daily lives, that when sales tax is added, it actually applies and equals the specified amount; that the meter in a taxi shows the correct amount provided by law and correctly measures the actual distance; that when you order takeout, the price you see online matches the amount you pay in the restaurant,' he told the website. 'We all take most of this for granted.'\n",
      "294. Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne's financial director has been arrested as part of a probe into an alleged multi-million pound fraud at the entrepreneur's business. Christopher Paul Watson, 45, one of Mr Bannatyne's most trusted directors, was arrested on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position and later bailed. It came after employees of the Bannatyne Group, which runs hotels, spas and health centres across the country, alerted police investigating the fraud to a 'serious financial matter.' The financial director of Dragons' Den's Duncan Bannatyne (pictured) has been arrested on suspicion of defrauding the entrepreneur's multi-million pound business . In a ghost-written autobiography, Riding The Storm, the business mogul said Mr Watson was among his inner trusted circle and his 'senior team'. He describes Mr Watson as 'fantastic', saying that he helped negotiate the company out of a 'tight spot' during a difficult financial period. When describing the breakdown of his marriage to his second wife Joanne, Bannatyne also lists Mr Watson as one of the people who supported him through 'the most tumultuous two years of my life'. The book tells how Mr Watson helped the entrepreneur assess his options when it came to the divorce settlement. Companies House lists Mr Watson, a father-of-three, as both secretary and a director of Bannatyne Fitness Limited. It says he was appointed to the positions in February 2008 and December 2012 respectively. In his autobiography, Bannatyne (pictured left with the other so-called Dragons) described Christopher Watson as 'fantastic' and part of his inner trusted circle . A spokesman for Bannatyne's company, which is based in Darlington, said the investigation does not affect the day-to-day operation of the business. The company thanked police for their professionalism during the investigation so far. In a statement, the spokesman for Mr Bannatyne's company added: 'The police are investigating a serious financial matter reported to them by the Bannatyne Group. 'We are grateful for their thoroughness and professionalism. We have no comment to make except to say that it does not affect the current operation of our successful business.' The group did not comment on Mr Watson's current employment status. A spokesman for Durham Police said: 'We can confirm a 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position. 'The investigation involves an alleged multi-million pound fraud on a Darlington-based business. 'The man has been bailed pending further inquiries.'

      "295. Former federal MP Craig Thomson has been fined $25,000 for stealing union funds to pay for prostitutes but has avoided going to jail. Thomson, 50, was convicted of 13 counts of theft following cash withdrawals he made from a bank account belonging to the Health Services Union between 2003 and 2007 when he was the union's national secretary. He spent around $5000 of HSU members' fees on escorts and sex workers and lavish meals. In sentencing Thomson on Wednesday, Victorian County Court Judge Carolyn Douglas said his spending had been indulgent and constituted a significant breach of trust. Former federal MP Craig Thomson has been fined $25,000 for stealing union funds to pay for prostitutes but has avoided going to jail . She rejected a submission by Thomson's defence barrister Greg James that the offending was the result of 'the frailties of a man away from home'. One of the charges arose from spending on sexual services while he was at home, and one related to a $400 lunch with his wife that included a $200 bottle of wine. 'The gravity of the offending is the gross breach of trust involved,' Judge Douglas said. 'The seriousness is reflected in the continued confidence, or arrogance, of Mr Thomson in having no regard for the trust placed in him.' She said it was not the concern of the court that he engaged sex workers, but it was the court's concern he was using union members' money to do so. Thomson had appealed against both his 12-month jail sentence and conviction imposed by a Melbourne Magistrate earlier this year . Thomson had appealed against both his 12-month jail sentence and conviction imposed by a Melbourne Magistrate earlier this year. On Monday, he was acquitted of 49 charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception. Judge Douglas said it was regrettable the fraud charges had not been framed correctly and reiterated she would be sentencing on the theft charges only. She said the amount stolen was relatively small but Thomson's behaviour was nonetheless appalling. 'He is greedy,' Judge Douglas said. Judge Carolyn Douglas said it was regrettable the fraud charges had not been framed correctly and reiterated she would be sentencing on the theft charges only . During submissions on Wednesday morning Judge Douglas indicated she was considering a fine instead of jail time, but prosecutor Lesley Taylor QC called for a prison sentence, saying anything less would be manifestly inadequate. 'The moral culpability of Mr Thomson is extremely high,' Ms Taylor said. 'There is not one skerrick of remorse that Mr Thomson has demonstrated.' Mr James said Thomson's theft of $5000 did not warrant jail time and he had been penalised already. Mr James said media coverage of Thomson's legal battle had been 'extensive and intensive' and so intrusive Thomson and his wife had been unable to leave their home. Thomson has had to take out a $300,000 mortgage and sell superannuation assets to fund his defence against the charges, Mr James said. Thomson has three months to pay the $25,000 fine and must also pay compensation of $5650.\n",
      "296. A businessman who used profits from laundering millions of pounds for criminals and conned financial institutions to fund a property portfolio and buy a fleet of luxury sports cars has been jailed for six years. Aqeel Khan acted as a go-to man for criminals across the north of England and was jailed at Leeds Crown Court today after admitting money laundering, possessing a forged bank document and contempt of court. The National Crime Agency said the 38-year-old, from Bradford, used cash from money laundering and defrauding financial institutions to fund his property investments, including the Old Bus Depot - a well-known Bradford landmark - which he bought for £2.5 million in 2011. Bradford property developer Aqeel Khan, left, has been jailed for six years for laundering millions of pounds for criminals and conning financial institutions so he could buy houses and luxury cars; he was jailed today along with his employee Mohammed Zulqurnain, who was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison . Khan's brother, Atique Anwar Khan, left, coordinated the distribution of the cash and was given a six month suspended sentence and, Ajib Khan, right, was handed a six month suspended sentence . In total, Khan's network had £10 million of property assets, the agency said. The money used to buy the properties had been laundered through multiple bank accounts to try and conceal its source. Khan and his employee Mohammed Zulqurnain used insurance brokers as fronts for their criminal enterprise, obtaining finance from legitimate financial institutions for non-existent or vastly inflated insurance policies. The money was then used to buy property and to fund Khan's in a life of luxury, the NCA said. Police seized a fleet of his cars which including a Lamborghini, an Aston Martin and a Range Rover. Police seized a fleet of his cars which including a Lamborghini, an Aston Martin and a Range Rover . Police found almost £100,000 that was contaminated with drugs in a cupboard at the home of Ajib Khan . Zulqurnain, 36, today admitted money laundering and fraud and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years jail. He was sentenced along with two other men who were also from Bradford. Khan's brother, Atique Anwar Khan, 34, who controlled and coordinated the distribution of cash into third party bank accounts, was given a six month suspended prison sentence. Another associate, Ajib Khan, 34, who was previously convicted of supplying class A drugs, also admitted laundering money into property. He was given a two year suspended sentence. The NCA said almost £100,000 of cash contaminated with drugs was seized from Ajib's home. NCA branch commander David Norris said Khan had 'presented himself' as a successful and wealthy businessman, when in reality he was the head of a 'large-scale, sophisticated money laundering operation'. Mr Morris said criminal groups relied on people like Khan. He said: 'Organised criminals need people who can launder their cash to make it look legitimate and this group provided that service on an industrial scale.'\n",
      "297. A former trader at Royal Bank of Scotland has become the first UK banker to be arrested on suspicion of rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. City of London police and the Serious Fraud Office arrested the unnamed man at an address in Billericay in Essex on Friday morning. The SFO refused to give any more details, confirming only that an individual had been arrested in connection with one of its investigations. But sources confirmed that the individual worked at RBS and was involved in the trading of foreign current rates. A former trader at Royal Bank of Scotland has become the first UK banker to be arrested on suspicion of rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market . Six banks, including RBS and HSBC, were fined a total of £2.6billion by UK and US regulators last month for their part in the racket. Bankers, who called themselves the 'A-Team', ‘Three Musketeers’ and ‘The Players’ colluded online by sharing confidential information about clients’ currency orders to boost their bonuses. Experts believe this is just the first of dozens of arrests, with many traders facing jail for a scandal widely believed to be even bigger than the recent ‘Libor’ interest rate-rigging scam. The Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation into the sprawling ‘Forex’ market in July but until now has made no arrests, despite around 30 bank staff sacked or suspended. David Buik, a veteran financial commentator from broker Panmure Gordon, described the foreign exchange scandal as the ‘saddest episode in my 52 years working in the City.’ He said: ‘I’d be amazed if there were not many more arrests. 'The foreign exchange market is the biggest in the world so could make any wrongdoing related to Libor rates seem like a Vicarage tea party by comparison. Those found guilty of fraud should be sent to jail.’ Sources confirmed that the individual worked at RBS and was involved in the trading of foreign current rates . The development emerges as RBS is this week expected to give an update on its internal investigation into the Forex market, and the punishment meted out to rogue employees. It suspects that 50 former and current staff may have been involved - compared to just 21 involved in the Libor interest rate rigging conspiracy which also led to huge fines for banks, including RBS. It will be expected to demonstate it has taken a hard-line, piling the pressure on the SFO to make further arrests. When it was fined almost £400million last month, the state backed lender admitted that just six staff had been disciplined, including three suspended. John Mann, a Labour member of the Treasury Select Committee said: ‘I’d expect to see more arrests. Those involved should be held to account. But I would also expect those arrested to reveal the senior managers who turned a blind eye.’ Some are likely to be current or former employees of Barclays. The high street giant faces a fine of more than £500million for manipulating foreign exchange markets, despite refusing to settle with regulators in October. Its chief executive Antony Jenkins last week admitted that the £500million it had set aside to cover its bills would probably not be enough. Pressure is growing on the Government and authorities to claim the scalp of a high profile banker. More than seven years since the run on Northern Rock, not a single senior banker has been jailed for their role in the financial crisis. So far the Serious Fraud Office has arrested 13 employees for manipulating Libor interest rates used to set the cost of mortgages. Just one has been charged after pleading guilty in October to conspiracy to defraud. The names of the individual and those 12 others arrested have been protected by a court order.

      "298. Missed chance: Joe Lewis, 59, walked into a police station after apparently receiving death threats . Detectives missed a chance to arrest a currency trader wanted over an alleged £130million fraud, it has emerged. Joe Lewis, 59, walked into a police station earlier this month after apparently receiving death threats in the wake of telling clients his business had gone bust. But he has since vanished, leaving scores of angry investors – rumoured to include professional footballers and golfers – fearful they have lost all their money. The British businessman sent them an email on December 3 warning they would not receive any more payments because his company had stopped operating. He admitted his company stopped trading foreign currency in 2009 after suffering 'substantial losses' – but he continued taking investors' cash for the next five years. It is thought he may have used the new money to pay 'profits' to existing clients in a form of Ponzi scheme. Three days after sending the email, Mr Lewis walked into a Humberside police station. He told officers he had received death threats over the collapse of his investment business, according to one investor. But he was allowed to walk away because police were still deciding whether it was 'suitable' to make any arrests in the alleged fraud case. Mr Lewis is rumoured to have fled to Thailand, where he has business interests. Hull-born father-of-two Mr Lewis started his company JL Trading about a decade ago. The businessman's JL Trading website had a message yesterday saying it is 'no longer trading' (above) At its peak he employed about 30 staff in Istanbul. More than 800 people, most of them British, are thought to have invested money in his schemes. Many investors, some of whom are in their 70s and 80s, are facing financial ruin after handing over their life savings. One 57-year-old man who invested £570,000 in November 2012 fears he may only get £10,000 of the money back. The investor, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It’s all my retirement savings, every penny of it. I‘ve lost nearly half my net worth. I’m not bankrupt but I’m desperate. ‘Obviously my life is completely changed in view of what’s happened. The whereabouts of Joe Lewis, who traded from a luxury apartment overlooking the Bosphorus in Istanbul (pictured), is currently unknown after he apparently fled the Turkish city. He has not been heard from since . ‘There are other people who are in their mid-70s, and they have been left with literally nothing.’ A Humberside Police spokesman said: ‘On Saturday December 6, 2014, a 59-year-old East Yorkshire man voluntarily assisted the police with an investigation into alleged fraud offences. ‘When he left the police station the case was still being assessed for suitability of arrest. ‘Humberside Police are currently working with City of London Police Serious Fraud Office in connection with the alleged offences.’\n",
      "299. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is resigning from the board of a health care company that has profited from Obamacare following his decision to 'actively explore' a presidential campaign. Effective Dec. 31, Bush will no longer be employed by Tenet Healthcare or multinational financial services firm Barclays as disentangles himself from business interests that could cause conflicts if he declares his candidacy, as expected, for the 2016 competition. He has also stopped booking paid speeches, though he will follow through on previous commitments through early next year. Bush's spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told the Los Angeles Times that the former chief executive of Florida is 'reviewing all his engagements and his business commitments' as he makes the transition from businessman to politician, again. 'That’s a natural next step,' she said, referring to his 2016 considerations. Scroll down for video . Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is pictured here earlier this month speaking at the U.S. Cuba Democracy PAC's 11th Annual Luncheon in Coral Gables, Florida. Bush, who announced plans in mid-December to 'actively explore' running for president, will book no new paid speaking engagements until he's made a decision a spokesperson has said . Bush made official last week his interest in holding the office once held by both his father, George H.W. Bush, and brother, George W. Bush, a former governor himself. While he's maintained that he's merely considering a foray into the Republican presidential primary, his divestment of Tenet and Barclays suggests otherwise. The 61-year-old remains a partner in three private equity funds, including one offshore investment fund that is located in the United Kingdom and benefits an aviation services firm based in Hong Kong, that have raised a combined $127 million, according to the LA Times. Another supports a Denver-based firm that invests in hydraulic fracking in Pennsylvania and New York, while the other props up a Marshall Islands business that transports propane. Bush's work in the business world dates back to '80s when he moved to Miami, Florida, and worked his way up to partner in a real estate development firm. He then served as Commerce Secretary in the Sunshine State for two years before resigning to join his father's re-election campaign. After his father's loss Bush decided to stay in politics, first as a campaign manager for Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and later as a candidate himself. He failed at his first attempt to be elected to public office but succeeded at winning the governor's mansion on his second try in 1998. Two consecutive terms as governor later, Bush reentered the private sector in 2007 and joined the boards of Lehman Brothers, which was later absorbed in part by Barclays after the 2008 financial crash, Swisher Hygiene, InnoVida, Rayonier and Tenet. Building materials manufacturing company InnoVida went bankrupt in 2011 after the business' president defrauded investors, pocketing millions. He was found guilty of $40 million in investment fraud and sentenced to 121 1/2 years in prison. For his work with InnoVida, which he left in 2010, Bush received $468,901, but he paid $270,000 to a bankruptcy court as part of the company's settlement, the LA Times reports. Bush has since parted ways with Swisher Hygiene, as well. A once profitable sanitation company, its stocks took a dive in 2011 after an acquisitions spree and it never fully recovered. On Rayonier's website Bush is still listed as a member of its board of directors - a gig that pays $200,000. At the time of his resignation from Barclays Bush's compensation reportedly topped $1 million. Between direct payments and stock sales Bush also made close to $1.4 million in 2013 off of Tenet. Tenet was a major proponent of Obamacare and the hospital chain reaped significant profits from the individual mandate portion of the law that requires all Americans to sign up for health care, regardless of whether their employer provides it or not. The company's chief operating officer, Trevor Fetter, said in August that its second quarter performance this year is 'the best' he can remember since joining the company nearly two decades ago, per a report from Forbes, and credited a third of the growth to the Obamacare-fueled health care sign ups. Earlier this year he predicted that Obamacare would put the company up $100 million in earnings in 2014. Bush has said that Obamacare is 'flawed to its core' and 'doesn't work' while calling on Republicans to allow it to implode 'a little more organically.' He added, 'I think the best way to repeal ObamaCare is to have an alternative. We never hear the alternative. 'We could do this in a much lower cost with improved quality based on our principles, free market principles,' he said in an interview on ABC's This Week that aired last year. Tenet's chief executive, Fetter, told the New York Times in April that Bush had been vocal in his opposition to the Affordable Care Act while advising the company but suggested that he did not let his political views get in the way of his duties. He was able to separate his 'personal views and what is best for the company,' Fetter said. Bush's spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the nature of Bush's work with the company. In this November 1998 photo then Florida Governor-Elect Jeb Bush, left, laughs during a joint news conference in New Orleans with his brother, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Since leaving office in 2007, Jeb has made millions by giving paid speeches and advising buisinesses . As Bush distances himself from Tenet, it has already cozied up to another likely 2016 presidential candidate that takes a more favorable approach to the health care reform law: Hillary Clinton. Two weeks ago the health care organization announced its sponsorship of an Indian Wells, California, meeting of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation near Palm Springs. The company's president will even introduce Bill Clinton at a plenary session of the Jan. 26 Clinton Health Matters Activation Summit, reports Forbes. Despite her rumored candidacy for president, Hillary Clinton will continue her work with her family's non-profit and is slated to make paid appearances until at least February of next year. In the nearly two years since leaving the Obama administration Clinton is known to have racked up a nest egg of more than $5 million from speaking fees, a large chunk of which has come from the financial services industry. For his speeches, of which he has given on more than 100 occasions in the last eight years, Bush received roughly $50,00 an appearance, earning him undisclosed millions. An unknown number of those appearances were unpaid, however. As of last spring, Bush had also earned at least $3.2 million in board payments and stock grants, per an analysis by the New York Times, since leaving public office. Bush's previous business dealings will certainly come up in the presidential race should he proceed with his candidacy, and his relationship with Tenet is already being called his 'Obamacare problem.' But Al Cardenas, the former chairman of the American Conservative Union who headed the Florida GOP at the time that Bush was in office, told the LA Times this week that he didn't think Bush's business associations would ultimately blemish his candidacy. 'I think he’s always been an honest man in business and in politics,' Cardenas said. 'He’s comfortable with his actions and what he’s done. All the public wants to know is that you behaved honorably and that you care for them.' In 2016 polling Bush has consistently stayed at the front of a pack of presumed Republican candidates along with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as well as 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has said repeatedly that he's not running. The four men received 14 percent (Romney), 12 percent (Bush), 10 percent (Paul) and eight percent (Christie) of the vote in a Zogby poll released on Wednesday, beating out 11 other potential candidates.\n",
      "300. Currency trader Alex Hope, 25, is facing jail for a £5.5million Ponzi scheme . A currency trader nicknamed ‘King Popper’ after he spent £32,000 spraying himself with champagne is facing jail for a £5.5million Ponzi scam. Alex Hope, 25, boasted that he was a financial wizard as he swindled investors to fund his playboy lifestyle of exclusive nightclubs and gambling. He blew vast sums in exclusive casinos and in nightclubs around the world in a £2million binge. A jury of five men and six women unanimously found Hope guilty of fraud after just three hours and 57 minutes of deliberation. The court heard the former Wembley stadium catering manager reinvented himself as a currency markets expert after teaching himself economics. He eventually landed an office job with City-based training school Forex Academy, then met his ‘mentor’ Raj Von Badlo, 56, while working as an independent trader at Zone Invest. By the end of 2011, investors were pouring cash into the trading scheme and huge sums were appearing in Hope’s bank account. Hope pocketed an ‘eye-watering’ £5.5million in just 13 months, between March 2011 and April 2012 - which he used as a ‘personal piggy bank’ to fund his extravagant lifestyle. He spent £32,000 in one evening at a Champagne Spray event in the five-star Grange Hotel near St Paul’s Cathedral earning him the title ‘King Popper’. Prosecutor Sarah Clarke said: ‘This was an event that was organised where people could go to this hotel and buy bottles of champagne and, in effect, spray them over each other. Hope can be seen in a video of the event wearing a drenched blue t-shirt as hundreds of bottles of expensive champagne are sprayed around a packed room. Scroll down for video . Alex Hope was dubbed 'King Popper' after he sprayed £32,000 worth of champagne in a club in London . Hope can be seen in a video of the event wearing a drenched blue t-shirt as hundreds of bottles of expensive champagne are sprayed around a packed room . Another night partying at the Playground Hilton in Liverpool was so excessive Hope hit the headlines for his spending. ‘Mr Hope spent £45,987 in one night, and the lion’s share of that went on this bottle, this Midas sized bottle, of Ace of Spades champagne that was opened effectively as a publicity stunt by him,’ said Ms Clarke. ‘The nightclub PR in fact ran up a bill of something like £200,000 and then it was put out in the press that this high-roller spent £200,000 in one night.’ The nightclub lover blew a whopping £65,113 in a single night at the Aura nightclub in Mayfair which boasts Buckingham Palace and the Ritz as its neighbours. Hope hit the headlines for his spending at the Playground Hilton in Liverpool . The court heard part of that night's tab included a bottle of Cristal bought for singer Rihanna. Jurors heard that Hope demanded a table next to Rihanna after she performed at Aura, a members only nightclub in London’s Mayfair that charges a minimum table spend of £800. He then treated the 26-year-old singer to a Jeroboam bottle of Cristal following her set at the exclusive venue on February 26, 2012. Hope also spent £1m to the Palm Beach Casino, whose website brags it is the ‘most exclusive casino in Mayfair’. He lost £353,600 after playing games where more than £5m was passed backwards and forwards over the table at the lavish venue he visited more than 81 times. But £604,400 simply disappeared from the cash deposited with the casino, probably in cash withdrawals, and has not been traced. Ms Clarke said it was ‘quite clear’ that Hope’s money ‘must have belonged to confirmed investors’ in his trading scheme. ‘Were any of the investors told that their money was going to be put into a casino and then withdrawn in cash for it to disappear?’ she asked. Receipts unearthed at Hope’s address showed just a ‘snapshot’ of his wild spending, including a taste for Christian Louboutin trainers and expensive watches. Hope also treated himself to luxury trips around the world, blowing nearly £64,000 on ‘upper class’ travel to Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Dubai. He blew £130,327 on a stay at beach front resort the Fontainebleu in Miami and racked up bills of £38,838 in one night at the Cirque du Soir in Dubai. A video filmed at the five-star Trump SoHo hotel in New York shows Hope pan around the luxurious suite and ends with a shot of his bed, strewn with money and designer clothes. ‘Here is the bedroom,’ he says, ‘just being silly, laying some money out, you can see the 50s and the 100s. ‘Did a little bit of shopping today as you can see, bought some Ralph [Lauren], bought some trainers as well, bought some Burberry... yeah, this is me.’ Videos taken from his mobile show him panning stacks of cash, in one he brags ‘£28,000 profit, boys’ and in a second ‘£50,000 profit, boys, ten, 20, 30, 40’ before cutting out. Ms Clarke added: ‘This gives you a snapshot of the ways in which he was enjoying himself, treating himself with investors’ money during the period of the fraud. ‘His trading really wasn’t keeping pace with what was coming in from investors and what was going out. ‘As the money from investors was increasing and his expenditure was increasing, in fact the amount of money that was being deposited on trading platforms in the first place was drying up to virtually nil.’ Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott, 30, lost £50,000 after investing in the fraudulent scheme. The midfielder, who plays for Crawley Town in Football League One, handed the cash to Hope after he promised 50 percent returns in just three months. Retired teacher Christopher Millard ploughed £25,000 of his own money into Hope’s fraud which saw him lose £15,000. Alex Hope with actress Layla Flaherty at London's 55 Club in 2012 . In one email to Mr Millard, he wrote: ‘I am a man of my word, I have never not paid anyone, let’s get that straight first and foremost.’ Hope and Von Badlo used extensive PR to lure investors into the scam and spent £3,000 a month of client’s cash on publicity provided by London PR firm Full Portion Media. In one ‘spectacularly successful’ promotional push, Hope and Von Badlo held a seminar at the four-star Copthorne Hotel in Slough on 10 March 2012. Glossy folders informed potential investors about the ‘Alex Hope Private Fund’ and the crowd heard Hope needed £5m to start his ‘dream’ hedge fund. He was presented as a financial whizz-kid, capable of making huge profits for his investors at the same time as sustaining trading losses of £500,000 and capital liabilities of more than £3,500,000. A second promotional stunt saw Von Badlo interview Hope outside the Old Trafford football stadium in September 2011 for a video intended to impress potential investors. In it Hope boasts: ‘It is very easy to make quite a lot of money.’ Hope was using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave the scheme, in the classic Ponzi fashion. After suspicions around his Forex fund grew, the Financial Services Authority intervened and arrested him. Ms Clarke said Hope told a ‘pack of lies’ and added his trading was ‘spectacularly unsuccessful’. ‘The truth was this was not a successful trading scheme, in fact it wasn’t a trading scheme really at all - it was a fraud,’ said Ms Clarke. He admitted violating City rules which state he must have a licence from to work on behalf of others, although he is allowed to trade currency for his own profit. Hope, of Canary Wharf, east London, denied one charge of fraud. He pleaded guilty to carrying on a regulated activity when not an authorised by the FSA. Von Badlo, of Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, admitted making misleading statements and communicating an invitation or inducement to encourage investment activity following the collapse of the first trial. Judge Deborah Taylor told Hope: ‘I am adjourning this case for sentencing until next Friday at this court, in the meantime you are remanded in custody.’ The pair will return to Southwark Crown Court on 16 January to be sentenced.\n",
      "301. Two men are accused of handling £100,000 taken from women who were snared by an 'elaborate and cruel' dating scam and a separate swindle that promised large fake lottery wins. Sufyan Yesufu, of Bristol, allegedly received more than £7,000 belonging to a woman taken in by a fraudster she met on dating website eHarmony who was persuaded to send money to Nigerian bank accounts. He is also accused of handling tens of thousands of pounds from two American women who were duped by the promise of a fake lottery win. Samuel Hukporti, of Sheffield, is also said to have received cash from one of the victims. They are both accused of handling money which had been obtained by 'elaborate and cruel deceptions' by the promise of love or great wealth. Two men are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of handling and receiving money obtained from women who were duped in three separate frauds - one involving an online dating swindle and the other a lottery scam . Neither man is accused of carrying out the three separate frauds directly but are thought to have been part of 'various arrangements made to receive, distribute and spend' the money. Denise Richards, from Australia, was the victim of the first fraud. Ms Richards was 56 when she struck up an online romance with ‘Charles Carroll’ on dating website eHarmony. ‘They corresponded by email at first and then they started to speak over the telephone,’ Thomas Payne, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey. ‘Ms Richards was totally taken in by Charles and she told him on numerous occasions that she loved him. ‘Charles emphasised to Ms Richards that he was a wealthy man and was working in London for an oil company and was owed approximately $2.5m for work he was doing for them.’ But 'Charles' soon started demanding money, saying he needed a $6,000 for a barrister to help retrieve his unpaid wages and $12,000 for an ‘access code’ to his bank account. Ms Richards, who lived in New South Wales, was asked to send thousands to four men in Nigeria. ‘Among the people who received money from Ms Richards was the defendant Mr Yesufu,’ said Mr Payne, who told the court she sent the equivalent of £7,611.60 to him. A laptop seized from Yesufu’s Bristol home had photographs of paperwork from the transfer, the jury was told. One of the women, of Australia, was duped by a man she met through online dating website eHarmony . The other two cases concern a fake lottery scam, where two women were duped to send over cash to release large sums of money they had supposedly won. Adelle Allen, of California, received a letter ‘out of the blue’ saying she had won $715,810 in the Spanish National Lottery. Excited at the prospect of the win, Ms Allen started pouring thousands of dollars into releasing the promised winnings, which she was told increased to over a million dollars, jurors heard. Yesufu is said to have received £71,094.03 in money transfers made between 4 October 2006 and 17 May 2007. Hukporti claimed £14,284.53 on 23 October 2007 from the victim, jurors heard. The cash was deposited into bank accounts with little to no cash in them and spent or withdrawn rapidly after the transfers, the court heard. Mr Payne added: ‘In fact she hadn’t won anything at all, this was just a cruel ruse to trick her into handing over money... ‘The fact is that poor Ms Allen was taken in by it and, in the hope of claiming her winnings, she parted with a substantial sum of her own money and all for nothing.’ He added: ‘In this case the defence do not dispute that the sums Ms Allen was tricked into handing over are criminal property because they were the proceeds of a fraud.’ Grace James, of Virginia, was also fooled into sending thousands to Yesufu, the court heard. Ms James received an email informing her she had won £4.5m in the National Lottery and was instructed to set up a bank account to receive her winnings, sending thousands overseas to unlock her prize, including £25,000 to Yesufu. Mr Payne added: ‘A sad and familiar picture emerges. ‘She took out loans to raise the money and has been left in a parlous financial position.' Mr Payne said the case concerns three separate frauds where people were duped into sending large sums which were transferred to bank accounts controlled by different people, including Hukporti and Yesufu. He added: ‘In each case the defendants were the recipients of sums of money obtained from people who were the victims of elaborate and cruel deceptions. ‘The victims were snared by promises of great wealth or love and were induced to part with huge sums of money.' Yesufu, of Bristol denies three counts of acquiring criminal property and a single charge of entering into a money laundering arrangement. Hukporti, of Sheffield, denied a single count of acquiring criminal property. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
      "302. A Spanish court is to hear a paternity suit brought against ex-King Juan Carlos by a 48-year-old Belgian woman who claims to be his daughter. Ingrid Sartiau maintains her mother had a relationship with Juan Carlos that lasted into 1966, the year she was born. Juan Carlos and former Queen Sofia were married in 1962. The 78-year-old could be ordered to take a paternity test if there is sufficient evidence to back the woman's case, a court spokesman said. Scroll down for video . 'He's my father': Belgian housewife Ingrid Sartiau (left), 48, has launched a paternity suit claiming she is the daughter of 78-year-old former Spanish King Juan Carlos (right) It is a further embarrassing episode for the father of King Felipe VI who abdicated last year in a move aimed at restoring the Spanish monarchy's popularity. A string of scandals had identified the royals as woefully out of touch, including a secret, luxury elephant-hunting trip by Juan Carlos in Africa at the height of Spain's economic crisis. The abdication of the 78-year-old former king, who has had health problems and walks with a cane after multiple hip operations, also led to the loss of his judicial immunity. A palace spokesman declined comment on the case yesterday. Paternity suit: Ingrid Sartiau maintains her mother had a relationship with Juan Carlos that lasted into 1966, the year she was born. Juan Carlos and former Queen Sofia were married in 1962 . Spanish King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia wave as they appear on the balcony of the royal palace after the wedding ceremony of Crown Prince Feleipe de Bourbon and Letizia Ortiz in Madrid, Spain, in 2004 . The court rejected another paternity case brought against the former king by a 58-year-old Spanish man, Albert Sola, saying it did not meet legal requirements. Sola has claimed for years that his birth mother, the daughter of a well-known Barcelona banker, may have had an affair with Juan Carlos before he married Queen Sofia. He and Sartiau made headlines in Spain in 2012 when they teamed up and underwent DNA tests that they said showed there was a 91 percent chance that they had one parent in common. Spanish lawmakers rushed through legislation after his abdication to prevent Juan Carlos being tried in ordinary courts. However, he can still be tried in the highest Spanish court, the Supreme Court. Although King Felipe consistently scores highly in opinion polls, his family continues to draw unwelcome headlines. His sister, Cristina de Borbon, is due to stand trial on tax fraud charges in the second half of this year. She will be the first member of the royal family to stand trial since the monarchy was restored in 1975. Juan Carlos was for decades held in high esteem for steering Spain from military dictatorship to democracy. He took over the throne in 1975, two days after the death of longtime dictator Gen. Francisco Franco. But his reputation plummeted after he took a secret elephant hunting trip to Botswana in 2012 at the height of Spain's financial crisis. He later apologized for the trip.\n",

Ali al-Marri was arrested in December 2001 while attending graduate school in central Illinois. He was held without charge for nearly six years in a U.S. Navy brig in South Carolina where lawyers said he endured lengthy interrogations, isolation, and threats to harm his family. This March 10, 2009, file image of a courtroom drawing from U.S. District Court shows alleged al-Qaeda sleeper agent Ali al-Marri as he made an initial appearance with his attorney Andy Savage in Charleston, S.C. Al-Marri's nephew, Saleh Garallah Kahlah al-Marri, said Sunday that his uncle returned home and was greeted by representatives from the Qatari interior and foreign ministries. Marri, who was in his mid-40s, was detained as a material . witness to the September 11 attacks. Former President George W. Bush declared him an 'enemy combatant.' He entered the United States legally on Sept. 10, 2001 but was suspected of being an al Qaeda agent sent by the militant group to disrupt the U.S. financial system by hacking into bank computers. He admitted to training in al-Qaeda camps and staying in al-Qaeda safe houses in Pakistan between 1998 and 2001. He also admitted to having contact with accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, who allegedly helped the hijackers. At his trial, he expressed sorrow for helping al-Qaeda and said he never intended to hurt anyone. No evidence showed he had a specific mission in the U.S. But U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm determined that al-Marri's decision not to change course after the 9/11 attacks showed he intended to remain with the terrorist organization. Al-Marri could have faced up to 15 years in prison. Mihm sentenced him to only eight years and four months behind bars because of what the judge called his 'unacceptable' treatment in the Navy brig. Former President George W. Bush declared Marri an 'enemy combatant' He was charged with credit card fraud and lying to the FBI and held for 18 months before the U.S. government dropped the charges in 2003. The Supreme Court agreed in December 2008 to consider his challenge of his status as an 'enemy combatant' and he was handed over to civilian authorities to stand trial in Illinois. In 2009, Al-Marri pleaded guilty to one count of providing . material support and resources to a foreign terrorist . organization. Despite this, his lawyer, Andy Savage, confirmed that he has now been released from federal prison . in Colorado in the last few days and is at home in Doha, Qatar. Al-Marri's nephew, Saleh Garallah Kahlah al-Marri, said Sunday that his uncle  was greeted by representatives from the Qatari interior and foreign ministries. 'He is in high spirits,' Saleh al-Marri said. His nephew thanked Qatari officials for their help in getting al-Marri back home, saying they made 'tremendous efforts' to do so. However, he added that Al-Marri would not be making comments to the media because 'we want to give him an opportunity to reintegrate into society.' The U.S. Bureau of Prisons had no immediate comment. His lawyer said the speed of his client's departure came as a surprise.\n",
      "304. Con: Daniel Burgoyne (pictured) compared himself to a character from The Wolf of Wall Street . Posing with a fat cigar and a flute of champagne, he compared himself to the Wolf of Wall Street. Daniel Burgoyne, 24, who boasted of being a ‘real diamond geezer’, persuaded dozens of people to entrust their savings to him for investments in carbon credits, gem stones and wine. But in fact, he was merely a former butcher with an NVQ in business studies who lived with his mother. And despite claiming to run his business from a prestigious address in the City, he was based on a business park in the Kent seaside town of Folkestone. Yesterday, the conman was branded the ‘Fox of Folkestone’ as he was jailed for two years for cheating investors out of £75,000. Like his idol, whose life was made into a Martin Scorsese film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Burgoyne lived a lavish lifestyle. Police discovered the Rolex-wearing criminal was not the financial high-roller he pretended to be among his friends and family. He posted pictures on Facebook of a BMW, piles of cash and of him holding a magnum of champagne. Yet far from having any financial acumen, he had tricked 18 people into giving him their money. Prosecutor Jim Harvey said he tricked people into thinking they were investing in wine or diamonds and offered unrealistic returns. One investor spent almost £33,000 on a diamond and was told it would increase in value by 1.9 per cent every month but would be kept in Switzerland for tax reasons. Canterbury Crown Court heard how Burgoyne operated through his two companies Elite Broker Company and Elite Commodity Markets. Burgoyne's lawyer said he was 'dazzled by all the glamour he saw around him' in the financial world . Boast: Photos online showed a black BMW. It is thought he blew more than £56,000 before being caught . Flash: The 24-year-old conman posted a photo on Facebook showing off about a Rolex watch . Detectives found evidence that he blew more than £56,000 on the ‘high life’ until he was caught, including £2,130 on wine, £1,500 on gambling and £1,115 dining out. Police seized £27,427 from his account before it could be spent. His barrister Anthony Abell said Burgoyne gained two A-levels with poor grades and did not go to university but worked as a butcher in his teens. He said Burgoyne claimed he had been ‘headhunted’ by a company trading in carbon credits and when it went bust he started his own company. Mr Abell added: ‘He was a rather ambitious young man who was dazzled by all the glamour. But he is genuinely sorry for his lies which he made to close deals.’ Judge Simon James said that Burgoyne’s photographs laid bare how he spent ‘considerable amounts’ on a ‘lavish lifestyle’. He said: ‘This was a sophisticated deception in which just £10,000 of the £80,000 you received was actually invested – and even then not in anything which would produce proper returns for the investors.’ Comparison: Under this photo (right) a friend said Burgoyne's selfie could have been a still from The Wolf of Wall Street (left), the film about conman Jordan Belfort - to which Burgoyne replied: 'It was' Wad: Burgoyne's online life showed off about his riches while investing just £10,000 of the money he took . After he was jailed, friends poked fun at Burgoyne, who had previously posted pictures of DiCaprio online and referred to himself as imitating the Wolf of Wall Street. One wrote on Facebook: ‘A tragic tale of the Fox of Folkestone.’ Another added: ‘The Fraudster of Folkestone.' Burgoyne admitted 18 fraud charges and was banned from being a director of a limited company for seven years.

      "305. Magnus Peterson has been jailed for 13 years after being found guilty of a string of fraud offences having duped investors out of hundreds of millions of pounds . A hedge fund boss whose investors lost £350million when his Mayfair firm collapsed as a result of his rogue trading has been jailed for 13 years. Magnus Peterson forged relatives' signatures, wrote fraudulent IOU's and lied to auditors to keep the Macro Fund afloat while he extracted millions from the company for himself. The fund collapsed in 2009 in an 'emblematic' example of the financial crash, with 51-year-old Peterson convicted of eight counts of  years later. Today the Swedish national was jailed for 13 years at Southwark Crown Court. The father-of-four was previously ruled against in a High Court action launched by creditors of one of his companies. It was this ruling which prompted the Serious Fraud Office to criminally investigate the financier after previously fearing there was no 'realistic prospect of conviction'. During his three-month trial at Southwark Crown Court, jurors heard how Peterson blew 20 per cent of the fund over a few days of 'disastrous' trading. Having convinced investors - many of whom were pensioners - to agree to an 'option overlay', Peterson told clients they could not lose or gain five per cent of their original input. The trader began using a separate company, Weavering Capital, to mask how much of his clients' money he had lost. Trading with money from the Macro Fund, he invented deals and profits produced by the latter company to keep the scheme going. At one point the financier forged the signatures of his father-in-law and brother in Sweden on documents including one declaring responsibility to the Irish Stock Exchange. But following the credit crunch of 2008, investors began seeking returns on their original cash instalments. It was then that Peterson launched a Ponzi-like scheme - using fresh cash investments to pay off debts to older clients. As jurors were told, 'he was robbing Peter to pay Paul.' In 2009, the Macro Fund was closed and Peterson later arrested in one of the first prosecutions of its kind following the financial crash. The Serious Fraud Office did not pursue allegations of fraud however in the belief there was no realistic prospect the trader would be convicted. The case was closed in 2011. The following year, a High Court action launched by Weavering Capital creditors however found he and some others liable for millions. Mr Justice Peter Smith (left) described the trader as 'charming and clever'. The criminal case into his practices was reopened by David Green QC (right) when he took charge of the Serious Fraud Office . In its wake and with the appointment of David Green QC at the SFO alongside threats of a judicial review from scorned creditors, the case was reopened. While swindling investors out of millions, it emerged Peterson had pocketed £7million for himself by the time he was brought to court. He was found guilty of fraud, forgery, false accounting and fraudulent trading and acquitted of seven other counts including fraud by false representation. Sentencing today, Mr Justice Peter Smith said the trader had 'fooled' those who trusted him with investments. August 2003: Macro Fund launched on Irish Stock Exhchange . March 2009: Fund put into administration . April 2009: Joint administrators mount proceedings against Peterson . September 2011: Serious Fraud Office drops investigation . October 2011: Civil trial at High Court begins . May 2012: Peterson ordered to pay £289million in damages for defrauding investors . July 2012: Serious Fraud Office reopens criminal investigation . December 2012: Peterson is charged with fraud offences . October 2014: Criminal trial begins at Southwark Crown Court . January 2015: Peterson is jailed for 13 years . 'You were playing for high rewards and the punishment should reflect that, which is why I am sentencing you to 13 years in prison. 'Investors were entitled to expect integrity from you. 'The jury found you guilty on eight counts of disloyalty, fraud and forgery. The Macro fund was liquidated in 2009 with losses of more than half a billion dollars for investors. 'You are a clever man and the fraud was clever, dishonest and sophisticated. You are articulate and have charm and your submissions to the jury were fluent although they made no real sense. He added the man had duped regular people out of hard-earned savings and contributions intended for charity. 'These were not just adventurous speculators, they included those saving for their pensions and charities. 'You did not have direct dealings with those cheated, but you knew well enough who would be your sorts of victims. 'It is no excuse that others might have been expected to safeguard the interests of others, and that others were involved in your wrongdoing. 'You acted in concert with others and it beggars belief that you were not leading a scheme and that others were not led by you.' According to the Serious Fraud Office, it was one of the first hedge fund prosecutions of its kind to arise out of the 2008 financial crisis. Amanda Pinto, QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, said: ‘This case is about a fraud carried out by Mr Peterson, through the investment fund the Macro fund, which he ran between 2003 and 2009. 'Investors put millions of dollars into the Macro fund...In the end, the fund went down to the tune of over 600 million dollars, losing all their money. ‘And this was not because of bad luck or incompetence - this was because of dishonesty.’ Southwark Crown Court (above) heard how the trader had 'fooled' investors into giving him more money . ‘The Macro fund was in dire straits’, Miss Pinto added. ‘At the very same time, he was personally extracting hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the Macro fund for his own and his family’s benefit.’ Gideon Cammerman, representing Peterson, said: 'There was a sense he was bound to be discovered. 'WCF was impecunious, the repayments could never have been met. The fraud was sustained over a period of time with a large number of victims.' He described Peterson’s actions as 'foolhardy and stupid', but added they were not to make him rich but to maintain his lifestyle. Dressed in a checked shirt, grey jacket and dark blue trousers, Peterson looked stunned as he was led away.\n",
      "306. A disgraced politician accused of defrauding $200million of government funds used some of the money to buy cars, homes and luxuries for a prostitute with whom he had a son, it is claimed. Mario Zelaya, 46, the former head of the national health service in Honduras, became infatuated with Natalia Ciuffardi, 28, after he met her at a strip club-cum-brothel in Chile. He showered her with gifts and promised to help her leave the Platinum Club brothel in the capital Santiago de Chile, where she was working as a high-class prostitute charging £300 an hour. The Chilean Geisha: Natalia Ciuffardi, 28, was the mistress of Honduran health chief Mario Zelaya, who is alleged to have used money from a $200million fraud to buy her homes and cars . Secret affair: Ciuffardi pictured with Zelaya, former director of the Honduran national health service, who showered her with valuable gifts and eventually fathered a son with her . In custody: Ciuffardi is now facing potential extradition to Honduras after she was implicated in the scam . Eventually Ciuffardi fell pregnant and Zelaya, already a married father-of-three, bought her homes and cars as well as sending her thousands of dollars a month to look after their son. But she is now facing extradition to Honduras after she was implicated in the $200million fraud allegedly orchestrated by Zelaya over the four years he spent in charge of his country's public health system. She maintains her innocence. 'He was very charming and I had no reason to suspect that the money he was giving me was not his own. How am I supposed to know that he had been stealing it?' she was quoted as saying by Central European News. 'I fell in love with him and when I became pregnant it was logical for me to leave and start a new life with the man who I thought I knew.' Chile's courts are due to make a decision this week on whether to extradite Ciuffardi. According to her statements about to the court about her relationship with Zelaya, she first met him while working as a prostitute in 2011. On that first night, she said, he had appeared at the Platinum Club in a group and spotted her when she sat down where he would be able to see her. He soon asked a waiter how he could be with her, she said, and she had sex with him after he agreed to pay about $230. They began an affair, with the wealthy politician treating Ciuffardi to beach holidays and beseeching her to give up her work as a prostitute. She said he would spend one week in every month with her, and that he had apparently been telling his wife, Michelle Alejandra Flores Borjas, 42, and their three children that he was in Chile on business. Police said she continued working as a stripper and prostitute but stopped when she got pregnant, after which Zelaya maintained her with monthly payments of up to $5,000 a month. His generosity did not stop there. As their relationship continued, Cuffiardi is said to have received gifts including two apartments, a house on the beach, two SUV cars, expensive perfumes, watches, clothes and purses. Pro-business: Zelaya got his job at the head of the Honduran health service after a military coup ousted the country's left-wing president Manuel Zelaya - no relation - in 2009 . High-class prostitute: Ciuffardi and Zelaya met while she was working as a hooker at the Platinium club in Santiago de Chile. They began an affair after he paid her about $230 for sex . But in early 2014 it all came to an end when a Honduran court ordered Zelaya arrested on charges of fraud, bribery, abuse of public funds and money laundering. Zelaya fled, but not before warning his girlfriend he may never see her again. 'The first I knew that anything was wrong was when he called me and asked me to forgive him. He said I'll understand him one day,' she said. 'He asked me to always say good things about him to our son. And that he felt sorry for what happened, but we are never ever going to meet again.' Last September Zelaya was finally captured in the southern state of El Paraiso, which borders Nicaragua. Prosecutors discovered more than $7 million worth of assets including mansions, apartments, land and vehicles under Zelaya's control. It was a dramatic fall from grace for Zelaya, who had been a respected doctor and also served for several years in the Honduran army. His rise to power began in 2009 when Honduras's left-wing former president Manuel Zelaya - who is of no relation - was ousted in a coup backed by the U.S. The country's new president, Porfirio Lobo, appointed Zelaya to the top post on the IHSS. Dana Frank, a Honduras specialist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said that under Lobo crime and corruption mushroomed. 'They just threw the rule of law out the door,' she told the New Orleans Advocate, adding that since the coup the country's leaders have clamped down on civil liberties, including freedom of speech. The wife: Michelle Alejandra Flores Borjas, who is also implicated in Zelaya's alleged embezzlements . Soon after his appointment, Zelaya is alleged to have begun accepting $2million in bribes from a Honduran consulting company, said to be the beginning of a campaign of fraud and embezzlement which took in unjustified purchases, exorbitant contracts, airline tickets, travel and hotel stays. Zelaya left the IHSS, which covers 1.6 million Hondurans, in precarious financial shape after allegedly overpaying companies, some formed by his former IHSS subordinates, according to Honduras's National Anti-Corruption Board. Now Ciuffardi is part of the corruption probe as well. She said the fact that officials in Honduras had not even realised the money was stolen for so long meant that it was also impossible for her to know. She said: 'He told me he would change my life. He promised he would help me leave my job and we would build a home together. I believed him and I fell in love with him.'\n",
      "307. A gang of computer hackers is believed to have stolen tens of millions of pounds from UK banks in the largest cyber-crime ever detected. The massive theft was part of a bold £650million raid, meticulously orchestrated over the past two years, on more than 100 financial institutions around the world. Attacks by the gang, thought to be based in Russia but with members in Ukraine and China, are feared to be continuing, despite being investigated by Interpol and international authorities. A gang of computer hackers is believed to have stolen tens of millions of pounds from UK banks by ordering ATM machines to dispense cash at pre-determined times – even without a bank card. It is unknown which banks have been targeted, and the scale of losses to British banks has not been disclosed (file photo) The computer scam was so sophisticated that the gang, known as Carbanak, was apparently able to order ATM machines to dispense cash at pre-determined times – even without a bank card. The cyber-criminals would pull off a raid by first gaining entry into a bank employee's computer. They did this by sending authentic-looking emails that unsuspecting recipients then clicked on, inadvertently infecting the bank's machines with Carbanak malware – a technique known as 'spear phishing'. Hackers were then able to infiltrate the internal network and track down administrators' computers for video surveillance. This allowed them to see and record everything that happened on the screens of staff who serviced the cash transfer systems, which meant the fraudsters got to know and could mimic every last detail of bank clerks' work. The cyber-criminals were able to hack into a bank employee's computer, allowing them to record everything happening on-screen and then mimic workers online to transfer money into dummy accounts (file photo) They used this information to impersonate bank staff online, in order to electronically transfer tens of millions of pounds from the bank into dummy accounts. On average, each robbery took between two and four months, from infecting the first computer at the bank's corporate network to making off with the money. Another method used was where the criminals would gain access to someone's account and inflate the balance many times over before transferring the cash. The raids, which date back to 2013, were finally detected by Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab, after a Ukrainian ATM was found to be giving out notes at random times - when no one had put in a card or touched a button. The scale of the crime was global, with banks in the US, China, Russia and Europe targeted. Security experts are trying to identify the banks hit but say customers, such as this man, have not been affected (file photo) Security cameras showed how money would be picked up by customers who appeared to be in the right place at the right time. Kaspersky's principal security researcher Vicente Diaz said the theft was unusual as it targeted banks directly, rather than individuals' bank accounts, and that the hackers seemed to set their limit to around £10million before moving onto another bank. 'In this case they are not interested in information. They're only interested in the money,' Mr Diaz said. 'They're flexible and quite aggressive and use any tool they find useful for doing whatever they want to do.' A spokesman for the firm added: 'The Carbanak criminal gang used techniques drawn from the arsenal of targeted attacks. The plot marks the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of cyber-criminal activity, where malicious users steal money directly from banks, and avoid targeting end users.' The scale of the crime was global, with banks in the US, China, Russia and Europe targeted, and the attackers thought to be expanding throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In one case, an unnamed bank lost $7.3million (around £4.7million) through ATM fraud. Another financial institution lost $10million (around £6.5million) after the attackers exploited its online banking platform. Kaspersky has not identified the banks hit by the scam, and is still working with law-enforcement agencies to investigate the attacks, which the company says are ongoing. Losses to UK banks have not yet been disclosed, but are thought to run into tens of millions of pounds. However, as the scam targets institutions rather than individuals, customers' accounts have not been affected. Despite the fact the fraud has been uncovered, it is feared that banks could be hit again, as once installed the malware can operate almost independently of the gang and is difficult to detect. Sergey Golovanov, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, said: 'It was a very slick and professional cyber-robbery'. Sanjay Virmani, director of the Interpol Digital Crime Centre, said: 'These attacks again underline the fact that criminals will exploit any vulnerability in any system.' 'Scale of the crime was global.' The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a non-profit organisation that alerts banks about hacking activity, said in a statement that its members received a briefing about the report in January. 'We cannot comment on individual actions our members have taken, but on balance we believe our members are taking appropriate actions to prevent and detect these kinds of attacks and minimize any effects on their customers,' the organisation said. 'The report that Russian banks were the primary victims of these attacks may be a significant change in targeting strategy by Russian-speaking cyber-criminals.' US authorities are putting an increasing focus on cybersecurity in the wake of numerous data breaches of companies ranging from mass retailers like Target and Home Depot to Sony Pictures Entertainment and health insurer Anthem. The White House wants Congress to replace the existing patchwork of state laws with a national standard giving companies 30 days to notify consumers if their personal information has been compromised.\n",
      "308. A former bank manager has pleaded guilty to systematically stealing over $1.4 million from two customers in suburban New York, including a 92-year-old ex-policeman. Bank manager: Maria Rodriguez of Mount Kisco has pleaded guilty to systematically stealing over $1.4 million from two customers in suburban New York . Maria Rodriguez of Mount Kisco entered guilty pleas Monday, Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore said in a news release. 46-year-old Rodriguez was a branch manager for M&T Bank in Ossining. Rodgriuez pleaded guilty to one count of third-degree criminal tax fraud, as well as one count of first-degree grand larceny and one count of second-degree grand larceny, DiFiore said. The district attorney said in the release 'We entrust our money and investments to our financial institutions and their employees. Both victims put their trust as well as their money in the hands of someone who they had faith in, but ultimately took advantage of that trust and stole from them.' Several of Rodriguez's subordinates called the bank's whistleblower hotline. The bank contacted authorities. DiFiore said the thefts began in June 2008. The first victim 'trusted the defendant to assist her with her personal banking and banking for her business,' the news release said. 'Over the course of five years, the defendant stole money from the victim by writing unauthorized checks to cash, making unauthorized cash withdrawals, and requesting an ATM card and making unauthorized ATM withdrawals.' The first victim had $1,112,127.40 stolen from her, DiFiore said. The 92-year-old victim used to a be a police officer in Ossining Village, according to DiFiore, and reportedly lost $256,644. DiFiore said in the release that the man thought he was withdrawing interest alone from his bank account. Rodriguez was instead making unauthorized withdrawals, she said. Rodriguez faces up to 25 years in prison when she's sentenced on May 20. Bank: 46-year-old Rodriguez was a branch manager for M&T Bank in Ossining, pictured .\n",
      "309. A 'devious and calculating' accounts manager who stole £23,000 from a TV star's home improvements company was jailed for 16 months today. Abeyomi Ogunagbadaro, 44, had only been working at home expert Alison Cork's Alison At Home furniture business in Regent Street, central London, for six weeks when he started stealing from the firm. The financial controller, who was on a £42,000-a-year salary, had access to the company's online bank account and was able to launder payments via two innocent friends he duped into giving him their bank details. 'Devious and calculating' accounts manager Abeyomi Ogunagbadaro (left) who stole £23,000 from a TV star Alison Cork's (right) home improvements company was jailed for 16 months today . Mother-of-two Ms Cork, 51, has appeared in a number of home and garden shows and is best known for her ITV series 'Don't Move, Improve'. Ogunagbadaro, who started work at the company Alison At Home on March 4 last year, admitted one charge of fraud by abuse of position and was jailed for 16 months when he appeared in front of Southwark Crown Court today. The fraud was only discovered after Ogunagbadaro had left the company in May of that year. Peter Zinner, prosecuting, said: 'This was a very sophisticated, pre-planned fraud by a devious and calculating defendant who abused his position as a financial controller to his own financial gain. 'The offence, say the Crown, was aggravated by the use of various lies and by the involvement of two innocent people in an attempt to launder, or disguise, where the monies were being transferred to. 'Those two innocent people were put in the threat of prosecution by their unwitting involvement.' Abeyomi Ogunagbadaro, 44, had only been working at home expert Alison Cork's Alison At Home furniture business, based on the third floor of this building in Regent Street, central London, for six weeks when he started stealing from the firm . Mr Zinner told the court that soon after starting with Alison At Home, Ogunagbadaro had made a number of mistakes, but had tried to cover this up by pretending that a young relative had died. 'His employment commenced on the 4 March 2014, but there were immediately problems during his probation period with accounting errors and processing errors which resulted in him being spoken to by supervisors,' Mr Zinner said. 'To elicit sympathy from his employers the defendant lied about illness and death of a child in his family and because of that he was given a little bit of latitude and time off.' However, the story was a sham and there had been no death or illness in his family. 'As his performance was not good he parted company, it seems amicably, with Alison At Home on May 7 but shortly afterwards the owners of the company decided they would do an audit and in particular they were concerned about three unrecognised transfers,' said Mr Zinner. Two payments of £4,000 each were made to Vanessa Murphy and a further £15,000 was sent to Daniel Collen. Mother-of-two Ms Cork, 51, (pictured) has appeared in a number of home and garden shows and is best know for her ITV series 'Don't Move, Improve' Interior design and homes expert Alison Cork is best known for her appearances on Peter Andre's 60 Minute Makeover and her own ITV daytime show 'Don't Move, Improve', where she travelled the country with co-presenter Michael Holmes. The pair would assess a homeowners’ current property and suggested two options of how they could renovate in order to meet their family’s needs. They would then return to see if the family had listened to their advice, and check out the finished results. Mother-of-two Ms Cork, 51, has also worked as a presenter on Carlton Food Network, the BBC and Channel 5, as well as radio stations LBC and BBC Radio Wales. She has also written on homes and interiors for numerous publications, including the Mail On Sunday. Ms Cork launched her furniture business Alison At Home in 2012, and has also been behind two collections for online site Made.com. She also offers help and advice on homes and decorating, as well as lifestyle and cookery tips via her Alison At Home website. Her latest venture, One Regent Place, which sells discounted home and garden products launched last year. Ms Cork is also an ambassador for The Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise (PRIME), which was set up by the Prince of Wales to help support entrepreneurs over the age of 50 and campaign for older workers' rights. 'The two payments were made without the consent or authority of the accountants signing off at Alison At Home, the recipients of the funds were not related to the business and suspicion fell on Mr Ogunagbadaro as he had actioned all the transfers.' Ogunagbadaro had tricked his friends into receiving the money by telling them he wanted to conceal a bonus payment from his family and lying that he needed help keeping the cash because he had a drug problem, the court was told. But Charles Shelton, mitigating, said there was 'still a chance of redemption' for his client. 'The whole situation is highly regrettable,' he said. 'We have here a man who was in a downward spiral of drink and drugs that reach its nadir.' He said Ogunagbadaro only spent '10 per cent' of the money on himself and used the rest to fund 'the shallow circle of friends who he doesn't hang out with any more'. But none of the money has ever been recovered and Ogunagbadaro has not paid a penny back. Judge Martin Beddoe said the fraudster was a 'mature and educated man'. 'Very shortly after starting a trusted job on a very good salary employed as a financial controller for this firm, you gained access to their online banking system,' he said. 'You were trusted to use it for the purposes of your job and you abused their trust in you by setting up the transfer for funds totalling £23,000 from your employer's accounts.' The judge added it took Ogunagbadaro only six weeks to set up the 'apparatus to defraud'. 'Apart from the seriousness of the deceit of your employers and the very considerable breach of trust as far as they are concerned, to commit this crime you had to trick, and did trick, with elaborate lies two friends of yours,' said Judge Beddoe. 'It was in my judgement a sophisticated fraud, sophisticated enough to be given that description and it involved gross breaches of trust along the way. 'There was nothing reckless about your conduct Mr Ogunagbadaro, it was quite purposive and deliberate.' The judge also criticised the defendant for blaming alcohol and cocaine as 'excuses latched on to'. Ogunagbadaro, of Kilburn, north west London, was led to the cells carrying his belongings in a Louis Vuitton rucksack.\n",

Deepak Dhankar, 29, used photos of a muscular, blond stranger and adopted the name 'Jamie' for a dating profile he used to arrange a tryst with a Melbourne woman because he thought it would get him more hits. The married father of three was sentenced to a community corrections order in the Victoria County Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to procuring sex by fraud after the woman discovered he was not who she thought he was. Deepak Dhankar, 29, used photos of a muscular, blond stranger and adopted the name 'Jamie' for a dating profile he used to arrange a tryst with a Melbourne woman . Dhankar, a financial planner, turned to online dating in 2012 after his third child was born and his wife became ill. In October that year he started chatting and exchanging explicit photos with the victim before they agreed to meet at her house for a sexual liaison. Dhankar let himself in through the unlocked door and entered the bedroom where the woman was naked and face-down on the bed. The two had agreed beforehand that 'Jamie' would play the role of a dominant and the woman would be a submissive. As part of that arrangement, Dhankar insisted she keep her eyes closed and never look at 'Jamie'. The woman consented to this and Dhankar performed sex acts on her while she lay on the bed. He then told her to go into her bathroom where their sexual activity continued until the woman's small child stirred. Married father of three was sentenced to a community corrections order in the Victoria County Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to procuring sex by fraud . Dhankar started chatting and exchanging explicit photos with the victim before they agreed to meet at her house for a sexual liaison in October 2012 . When the woman went to settle her child, she saw Dhankar's hand and realised he was not the blond he'd described himself to be. She decided to play along because she was afraid of what might happen if she let on she was aware he wasn't 'Jamie'. In her victim impact statement, she told the court the incident left her feeling violated and she suffered crippling anxiety and panic attacks as a result. Judge Jane Patrick told Dhankar on Wednesday it was a serious matter to obtain access to another person's body by deception and had he not pleaded guilty she would have jailed him. 'It appears that you chose this extremely selfish, immature and inappropriate way to deal with your frustrations arising from the problems you and your wife were having,' Judge Patrick said. The judge questioned the wisdom of the woman's actions but said that did not diminish Dhankar's moral culpability. Dhankar was sentenced to a two-year order that requires him to perform 200 hours of community service.

      "311. The world's nine wealthiest women are worth a combined $230billion - though they earned very little of the money themselves. The list of female billionaires continues to be dominated by women who inherited their money from their husbands and fathers who ran booming empires such as Walmart, Mars and L'Oreal. Of the world's billionaires, 286 are women, but only 17 per cent of that group are self-made, according to a report from wealth researcher Wealth-X. Of male billionaires, 60 per cent are self-made, Wealth-X president David Friedman said. Liliane Bettencourt's father founded the French cosmetics company L'Oreal in the 1900s . 1. Liliane Bettencourt, 92: $41.2billion from L'Oreal . Liliane Bettencourt, the 92-year-old heiress of French cosmetics company L'Oreal, surged to the top spot on the list of the world's wealthiest women on Friday when her stake in the firm gained $400milion in value, according to Forbes. The widow, who suffers from dementia and is no longer involved with running the company, inherited her stake from father Eugene Schueller, who first began selling beauty products in the early 20th century. In the 1950s she married Andre Bettencourt, who also worked at L'Oreal after being involved in a French fascist group that collaborated with Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II. He died in 2007 after leaving L'Oreal in the midst of revelations about his past. The years since Liliane's retirement from her father's company have seen her give away large sums of money, though there is currently a fraud trial of ten people accused of using her dementia to swindle her out of millions . Christy Walton, 60, married into the Walton family . 2. Christy Walton, 60: $41.1billion from Walmart . Christy Walton, 60, has been the world's wealthiest woman for long periods of time, including up until Thursday morning. With an accumulated wealth of $41.1billion inherited from her late husband, she holds the largest part of the Walmart empire's fortune, according to CBS. She married into the family through John, son of Walmart founder Sam. However, the retail heir died when a small plane he was piloting crashed in 2005. Christy and the rest of the Walton family made headlines after they did not sign on to Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett's pledge to give half their wealth to good causes while they were alive. The family has given an estimated .04 per cent of their wealth to charity. Sam Walton's daughter Alice devoted herself to art . 3. Alice Walton, 65: $38.6billion from Walmart . Alice Walton, 65, inherited her $38.5billion stake in her father's empire, though she has not been involved in running the business. She instead chooses to devote her time, energy and vast financial resources to art, building a 200,000-square-foot museum filled with modern works in northwest Arkansas, according to Forbes. The heiress's life has not been without troubles, however. Ms Walton, who has married and divorced twice without children, killed a woman with her car in 1988, though no charges were filed. She had a drunk driving arrest in 1998 and another in 2013 where she refused to take a breathalyzer and charges against her were later dropped. Though her primary residence is a horse ranch in Texas, she also owns two floors on Park Avenue where protesters demanded higher wages for her company's workers last year. 4. Jacqueline Mars, 75: $27billion from Mars Inc candy company . SJacqueline Mars's $26.8billion fortune stems from Mars Inc  (pictured 2012) Life for Jacquelin Mars has always been pretty sweet. She inherited $26.8billion from the company that bears her name, which her grandfather started in Washington at the turn of the last century. She shares the company evenly with her two brothers, Forrest Jr. and John. However she had an experience eerily similar to Ms Walton's fatal driving accident in 2013. She pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving after she ran into a minivan, leading to the death of an 86-year-old woman and causing a pregnant woman to miscarry her unborn child. The heiress paid $2,500 in the case, or .00000009 per cent of her fortune. 5. Laurene Powell Jobs, 51: $19.6billion . Laurene Powell Jobs, 51 (pictured 2013), inherited shares of Apple and Disney from her late husband . Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of late Apple founder Steve, is worth $19.3billion after a career in finance and inheriting stakes in the tech giant and Disney from her 1991 marriage. At 51, the graduate of  Stanford Business School is the youngest member of the list,which has an average age of more than 72. She keeps busy with her own set of initiatives, including running the Emerson Collective, which fosters entrepreneurship for the underprivileged and advocates for education reform. The businesswoman is also on the Board of Trustees at Stanford. Though she generally keeps a low profile, the widow was recently spotted on a Caribbean vacation with former Washington D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, 44. The pair are believed to have been dating since 2013. Susanne Klatten, 52 (pictured in 2009), worked for her father Herbert Quandt under an alias . 6. Susanne Klatten, 52: $17.2billion from BMW . While the majority of the world's nine wealthiest women are American, the sixth and eighth spots inherited their wealth from German automaker Herbert Quandt, who led the resurgence of BMW in the 20th century. Susanne Klatten, 52, began working for her father's company under an alias before marrying an engineer and inheriting stakes that make her worth $16.9billion. She also owns stakes in a wind turbine company, Nordex, and a chemical company called Altana. The mogul earned a bachelors at University of Buckingham in England, an MBA in Switzerland and has three children, according to Bloomberg. The driven woman's life has not been without difficulties, however. She had an affair with a Swiss businessman who threatened to publish sexual videos of her if she did not pay him $72 million. In 2009 the man was sentenced to six years in prison for blackmail. Anne Cox Chambers, 95, inherited a media empire . 7.  Anne Cox Chambers, 95: $17.1billion from Cox . The only media mogul among the world's wealthiest women, Anne Cox Chamber's inherited her stake in various Cox media ventures from her father James. A vast information empire, Mrs Cox Chambers has shares in companies including Cox Communications cable company, Kelley Blue Book automotive reselling manual and many local television and radio stations. She has remained active in various affairs beyond her father's businesses, however. The heiress served as ambassador to Belgium during the administration of President Jimmy Carter and was the first woman member of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. She also received the French Legion of Honor from Francois Mitterand. 8. Johanna Quandt, 88: $14.4billion from BMW . Johanna Quandt, 88, was the third wife of BMW's Herbert Quandt . Susanne Klatten's mother Johanna Quandt, 88, was Herbert Quandt's third wife after working as a secretary for the automaker. Beyond a large stake of the car manufacturer, which makes vehicles including Minis and Rolls-Royces, she also controls part of a security software company based in the Netherlands. Both parents of Mrs Quandt, maiden name Bruhn, were art historians. She now lives in the German spa town of Bad Homburg, near Frankfurt. Neither Mrs Quandt or Mrs Klatten have ever sold a share of Herbert Quandt's company. The family has come under fire for their links to Nazism during the reign of Adolf Hitler. Herbert Quandt's half-brother Habart was the son of the Third Reich's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. 9. Iris Fontbona, 72: $13.8billion from various ventures . Chilean Iris Fontbona, 72, received her money as part of an influential family as well as from a marriage to Andrónico Luksic . The ninth wealthiest woman is Chilean Iris Fontbona, 72, who gained her money from her family's copper business and company that owns Banco de Chile. She also married late Croatian-Chilean businessman Andrónico Luksic, and her wealth is currently estimated at $13.8billion. Her assorted business interests also include Chile's largest brewer and a resort in Croatia. The Luksices make investment decisions collectively, as a council. Michele Ferrero, the confectioner who was Italy's richest man, died on Valentine's day and his wife Maria Franca Fissolo is likely to inherit a large amount of his $23billion. Inheriting the entire amount would place her fifth among the world's wealthiest women. Seventy-nine per cent of the world's female billionaires fully inherited their wealth. The largest share of self-made women billionaires is in the US, with 40 per cent of Americans in the group making their own way. China, expected to soon have a larger amount of wealth concentrated in businesswomen's hands, comes in second at 22 per cent. The average age of all female billionaires is 61, with 21 per cent widows.\n",

England supporters made a mockery of Vauxhall’s fans engagement initiative by making goalkeeper Joe Hart MotM on each occasion despite him rarely touching the ball in either Euro 2016 qualifier. Joe Hart was voted man of the match in both of England's games against San Marino and Estonia . Fans voted for Hart as their man of the match not once but twice and England could change the system .

Arsenal say none of their direct employees have wages of less than that figure. But there are lower paid cleaners and catering staff who work for Arsenal-contracted companies who are responsible for their hourly wage. But the question submitted to the board says Arsenal’s strong financial resources and long tradition for doing things the right way should mean all personnel working at the club should be paid the London living wage. Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis will face some tricky questions at the club's annual meeting .

Unwilling to give up his celebrity life, he began breaking into lockers at the private health club in Camden, where he was a member, in order to steal credit card details. Medi Abalimba, 24 (left), has been jailed for four years after duping bars, restaurants, luxury stores and five-star hotels out of thousands of pounds by pretending to be Chelsea player Gael Kakuta . Abalimba was caught after trying to buy £20,000 worth of goods at Selfridges in the Trafford Centre (pictured) Blues winger Kakuta on his sixth loan spell at Chelsea after joining Rayo Vallecano . He would then go on spending sprees in luxury shops, five-star hotels and trendy nightclubs pretending to be winger Kakuta - who is on his sixth loan spell from Chelsea with Real Vallecano - while using the card details to pay. During one incident he duped starstruck staff into running up a £25,000 bar tab on Cristal champagne in one London club  claiming 'he was a Premier League star and good for the money.' He also ran up a £12,000 bill at three luxury London hotels, took a bar in Manchester for another £5,000, scrounged suites in luxury apartment complexes and spent £11,000 on limousines. On another occasion he took four star-struck girls from Manchester on a £1,100 helicopter tour over London before having them stay with him at an £800-a-night rented mansion in Berkshire, which he falsely claimed was his home. He also used another woman’s credit cards to rack up a £4,633 bill at a spa and to hire a Range Rover at a cost of £2,397. Abalimba took four girls on a £1,100 helicopter ride over London, before inviting them back to a £800-a-night mansion in Berkshire, saying it was his home . Abalimba was caught after he attempted to buy clothing worth more than £20,000 from Selfridge's at the Trafford Centre near Manchester - even practising his football skills inside while browsing. After being arrested, he claimed his one-time massive weekly wage left him with a 'wholly unrealistic' understanding of money. Abalimba was born in the Congo and had begun his career as a midfielder in the youth teams of Crystal Palace and Fulham, before moving to Southend United where he was paid £1,000-a-week at just 16 years old. He attracted attention from several Premier League clubs early in his career and was given trials at Manchester United and Manchester City. At Liverpool, he played for the reserves while the then manager Rafa Benitez watched from the stands and eventually signed for Derby County in 2009 for £1.2m. He was paid £4,000 a week and received an appearance fee of £1,000 as a substitute, and £2,000 for starting a match. But his career was curtailed by injury and he was sent to Oldham Athletic on a free transfer in January 2011 having failed to make a competitive appearance. In August 2012 he was signed by Farnborough Town with a wage of just £300-a-week and was forced to supplement his income with part-time work as a taxi firm controller. Fearing his friends would dump him, he turned to fraud in order to keep up the illusion of wealth. He called venues in advance, pretending to be Kakuta’s agent and advising them of his imminent arrival before using 'compromised' credit cards to pay for goods and services. He took friends for a night out in London where he duped staff at the Cirque du Soir burlesque club in Soho into giving him champagne after convincing them he had put his credit card behind the bar. When a waiter could not find the card, Abalimba said he was a Premier League footballer and showed the server photos of himself posing in football shirts with Premier League stars. He then racked up the five-figure bar tab entertaining a table of 10 guests, buying bottles of champagne which cost up to £5,000 each - even offering to buy bubbly for a man at the next table. In all he ordered two jeroboams of Cristal, each equivalent to four regular bottles, and used a microphone to invite the entire club back to his house for a party. At the end of the night, it was discovered he could not pay the bill and police arrived to arrest him. Abalimba once ran up a £25,000 bar tab in a London club, buying two jeroboams of Cristal champagne, telling bar staff he was 'good for the money (pictured, Abalimba is arrested) Kakuta (right) trains alongside former Chelsea team-mate Nicolas Anelka in 2009 . At the time he claimed he had been given a credit card by his French football club but was given a six-month suspended sentence. Just months later he phoned a trendy club in Manchester and put on an American accent, pretended to be the agent for Gael Kakuta and asked for a table. Throughout the the evening he posed as Kakuta to order champagne worth £2,600. At the end of the night claimed he had left his wallet in a limousine and told staff he had his credit card details over the phone. He also enjoyed drinks at several nightclubs and restaurants including the acclaimed Gilgamesh, run by head chef Ian Pengelley, where he ran up a bill of £8,000 for 20 of his friends. Kakuta had temporary spells at Fulham, Bolton, Dijon, Vitesse and Lazio . The payment, made using stolen credit card details, was authorised and Abalimba then pre-paid more than £2,000, telling staff he would return. The next night he drank champagne with friends before leaving in a chauffeur driven Bentley GT. Last July Abalimba went to Selfridges in the Trafford Centre where he chose more than £20,000 worth of clothing only to claim he could not pay with his credit card as it had been damaged. He later phoned the store to try and make a payment over the phone using the stolen credit card details. But just as a chauffeur was sent to collect the goods, a store detective became suspicious and withheld the items. Police traced Abalimba to a mansion where he had been staying and he later told police he regularly broke into lockers at a sports club in Camden using master keys,  and used his phone to photograph members’ credit card details. It emerged that in London he ran up huge bills during hotel stays, including £7,000 at the Corinthia hotel, £3,000 at Mandarin, £2,000 at Millennium Hotel and £1,400 at Bulgari Hotel. Officers found his fingerprints on a pair of Harvey Nichols shoes the fraudster had attempted to give out as a tip. In Manchester he deceived hotels including Park Inn, Worsley Marriott and the Great John St Hotel. He also attempted to book £4,206 worth of rooms at The Midland but was thwarted by extra security checks by staff there. He also tried to fraudulently obtain a £9,000 Rolex watch from a jeweller. At Manchester Crown Court, Abalimba, who is currently living in west London admitted three charges of fraud, taking a Range Rover without consent and making off without paying for £104 worth of petrol and asked for 19 other offences to be considered. After the case Sgt Adam Cronshaw of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Having spoken with many of the victims in this case it appears that Abalimba is a charming and charismatic individual who was able to call on his previous football experience and the fact he bears some resemblance to the real Gael Kakuta to deceive them. 'He was able to trick most people he came across and grew in confidence the longer the charade continued. He became so skilled in lies and deceit that his character went from being plausible to unquestionable. Kakuta made four loan appearances for Bolton Wanderers while on loan in 2011 . Kakuta (second left) made seven appearances for Fulham while on loan at Craven Cottage . 'Abalimba told us that many of his victims treated him so differently because they thought he was a celebrity footballer. Unfortunately this trust and goodwill was misplaced. 'While I have some sympathy for the way his career was curtailed, there can be no excuses for the persistent and deliberate frauds that have left numerous people and businesses out of pocket. 'I’m glad we were able to catch him and prevent further loss to other potential victims as he showed no signs of halting his activity. 'I hope more businesses are now aware of this scam and have the necessary security measures in place to prevent similar occurrences.' Police said the latest frauds totalled £163,000 but with no assets or cash to his name there is no opportunity for financial compensation to be paid to victims.\n",
      "314. A foreign currency trader accused of masterminding a £5.5m fraud to fund his playboy lifestyle was dubbed 'King Popper' after he sprayed £32,000 worth of champagne at revellers in a nightclub. Alex Hope, 25, allegedly concocted the £5.5m Ponzi fraud which he used to fund his gambling habit and penchant for spending tens of thousands of pounds on champagne at exclusive nightclubs, Southwark Crown Court heard. The former catering manager racked up a bill of £2m in just 13 months after visiting the clubs, buying large bottles of champagne and going to an exclusive Mayfair casino. Prosecutors described Hope's spending - which included splashing out almost £50,000 on a single bottle of champagne on one occasion - as 'eye-watering'. Today jurors were shown a video of his alleged activities. Scroll down for video . Alex Hope was dubbed 'King Popper' after he allegedly sprayed £32,000 worth of champagne in a club in London. The former catering manager is accused of masterminding a £5.5m Ponzi-style fraud . A video of the Champagne Spray event shows dozens of bottles of champagne which revellers spray on each other . Hope features in the six-minute video in a drenched blue t-shirt and black beads as champagne is sprayed . They said the amount of money he was spending must have represented  part of investors' money who had been persuaded to invest in his scheme after he offered huge returns. Hope reinvented himself as a currency markets expert and was promoted by Raj Von Badlo as a talented trader and financial whizzkid, it is claimed. Von Badlo has already admitted enticing people into fraud and making misleading statements. The 25-year-old set himself up as a successful Forex and currency trader, promising investors huge returns on cash funnelled into his scheme. In just 13 months he managed to take £5.5m. But many of his investors lost considerable sums of money - including Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott who lost £50,000. He is accused of running the scheme in a 'Ponzi fashion' - using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave it. The court heard that on one evening alone he spent £32,000 at the five-star Grange Hotel near St Paul’s Cathedral earning him the title ‘King Popper’. Prosecutor Sarah Clarke said: ‘According to the receipts he managed to spend about £32,000 in one night in February 2012 at something called the Champagne Spray event. ‘The was an event that was organised where people could go to this hotel and buy bottles of champagne and, in effect, spray them over each other.’ In a video shown to the jury Hope is seen wearing a drenched blue t-shirt and black beads as dozens of bottles of expensive champagne are sprayed around the room by revellers. And in a further example of excessive spending Hope spent almost £50,000 on a Midas sized bottle of champagne while partying at the Playground Hilton in Liverpool. Hope has been accused of masterminding the Ponzi style fraud to fund his champagne and playboy lifestyle . ‘Mr Hope spent £45,987 in one night, and the lion’s share of that went on this bottle, this Midas sized bottle, of Ace of Spades champagne that was opened effectively as a publicity stunt by him,’ said Ms Clarke. ‘The nightclub PR in fact ran up a bill of something like £200,000 and then it was put out in the press that this high-roller spent £200,000 in one night. ‘The truth was that he only spent a mere £45,000, £40,000 of that going on this bottle of champagne,’ she said. On another night he spent £65,113 at the Aura nightclub in Mayfair, close to Buckingham Palace and the Ritz. Hope also funnelled just under £1m to the Palm Beach Casino, whose website brags it is the ‘most exclusive casino in Mayfair’. Between joining the casino in November 2011 and his arrest in April the following year, he visited the lavish venue 81 times, jurors heard. Dozens of revellers are shown throughout the video spraying champagne and waving bottles with sparklers . He lost £353,600 after playing games where more than £5m was passed backwards and forwards over the table, it was said. ‘What that figure does seem to suggest is that he was an extensive and prolific gambler during that period,’ said Ms Clarke. ‘The amounts of money that were being lost... when he lost you may think he lost big.’ But £604,400 simply disappeared from the cash deposited with the casino, probably in cash withdrawals, and has not been traced, the court heard. ‘Were any of the investors told that their money was going to be put into a casino and then withdrawn in cash for it to disappear?’ asked Ms Clarke. Receipts unearthed at Hope’s address showed just a ‘snapshot’ of his allegedly wild spending. Hope is shown in the video where he is interviewed and asked if he is enjoying the champagne event . ‘The sums of money being spent is, the prosecution say, eye-watering and must have represented in whole or at least in very substantial part investors’ money and again you might want to ask yourselves if any of the investors were told that is what was happening to their money,’ said Ms Clarke. Hope also treated himself to luxury trips around the world, travelling to Miami, New York and Dubai, jurors heard. He spent £130,327 on a stay at beach front resort the Fontainebleu in Miami and racked up bills of £38,838 on night at the Cirque du Soir in Dubai. Ms Clarke added: ‘The Fontainebleu Miami trip was not the only luxury foreign travel experience that he treated himself to during this period with, we say, the investors’ money. ‘Bear in mind of course this was really a relatively short period of time as well. ‘We know he was enjoying them because he recorded some short films on his mobile of one particular trip he enjoyed to New York,’ she said. The video shows revellers at Champagne Spray, held at the five star Grange Hotel near St Paul's Cathedral . Revellers are shown soaking wet after dozens of bottles are sprayed around the room and at eachother . The video shows Hope in his suite at the five-star Trump SoHo hotel in New York. He pans around the luxurious suite and ends pointing the camera at the bed which is strewn with money and designer clothes. ‘Here is the bedroom,’ he says, ‘just being silly, laying some money out, you can see the 50s and the 100s. ‘Did a little bit of shopping today as you can see, bought some Ralph [Lauren], bought some trainers as well, bought some Burberry... yeah, this is me.’ Other short videos taken from his mobile show him panning stacks of cash, in one he brags ‘£28,000 profit, boys’ and in a second ‘£50,000 profit, boys, ten, 20, 30, 40’ before the video cuts out. Nearly £64,000 was spent on ‘upper class’ travel to destinations including Las Vegas and New York, it is said. And the spending did not stop there, with Hope allegedly using investors’ cash to fund a taste for designer clothes - particularly Christian Louboutin shoes and watches. Hope, of Canary Wharf, is on trial for fraud at Southwark Crown Court and has denied the single charge . Ms Clarke added: ‘This gives you a snapshot of the ways in which he was enjoying himself, treating himself with investors’ money during the period of the fraud. ‘His trading really wasn’t keeping pace with what was coming in from investors and what was going out. As the money from investors was increasing and his expenditure was increasing, in fact the amount of money that was being deposited on trading platforms in the first place was drying up to virtually nil.’ Jurors heard Christopher Millard, a retired teacher, ploughed £25,000 of his own money into Hope’s scheme which saw him lose £15,000. Hope promised him: ‘I am a man of my word, I have never not paid anyone, let’s get that straight first and foremost.’ Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott, 30, was also drawn into the scheme. Hope is pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court where he is on trial for fraud, which he denies . The midfielder, who plays for Crawley Town in Football League One, handed £50,000 to Hope after he promised 50 percent returns in just three months, but lost his investment, jurors previously heard. Ms Clarke said Hope told a ‘pack of lies’ and added his trading was ‘spectacularly unsuccessful’. Van Badlo, who does not appear in the dock with Hope, acted as the ‘promoter’ for the fund. He used PR companies to present Hope as a ‘talented and successful trader’, drawing £4,292,000 into the alleged scam.The pair also allegedly blew £3,000 a month of client’s cash on publicity provided by London PR firm Full Portion Media, jurors heard. Hope set himself up as a successful Forex and currency trader, promising investors huge returns on cash funnelled into his scheme. Through his deception, he took an ‘eye-watering’ £5.5m in just 13 months, between March 2011 and 3 April 2012, jurors heard. ‘The truth was this was not a successful trading scheme, in fact it wasn’t a trading scheme really at all - it was a fraud,’ said Ms Clarke. ‘Mr Hope was not a successful trader, investors funds were in fact paid into his personal bank account and they were used by him as his personal piggy bank,’ said Ms Clarke. Hope was allegedly using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave the scheme, in the classic Ponzi fashion. Hope has admitted violating City rules which state he must have a licence from to work on behalf of others, although he is allowed to trade currency for his own profit. After suspicions around his Forex fund grew, the Financial Services Authority intervened and arrested him. Hope, of Canary Wharf, east London, denies one charge of fraud. He has pleaded guilty to carrying on a regulated activity when not an authorised by the FSA. Von Badlo, of Buckinghamshire, admitted making misleading statements and communicating an invitation or inducement to encourage investment activity following the collapse of the first trial. Jurors were told this is a retrial and that jurors at the first trial were discharged before retiring to consider their verdicts. The trial continues.

    "The Pearson correlation matrix reveals strong positive correlations among all score types, with coefficients ranging from approximately 0.76 to 1.00. The BERT-based metrics (F1, Precision, and Recall) show the strongest intercorrelations (≥ 0.94), indicating that these metrics capture highly similar aspects of model performance. The ROUGE variants (ROUGE-1 F1, ROUGE-2 F1, and ROUGE-L F1) are also strongly correlated with each other (≥ 0.86), reflecting consistent evaluation behavior across the ROUGE family.\n",
    "Cross-metric correlations between BERT and ROUGE scores remain moderately to strongly positive (≈ 0.80–0.90), suggesting that while both sets of metrics align in ranking model quality, ROUGE captures slightly different nuances in text overlap compared to the semantic similarity focus of BERT-based measures."

    "Groups that share a Scheffé grouping letter are not significantly different from each other in terms of mean BERT F1 score. While many protected classes overlap in grouping letters, some pairs — such as Asian male and White male 2 — do not, indicating statistically significant differences in their mean scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANOVA results indicate no statistically significant differences in BERT_F1 scores across the protected classes (p = 0.802). Although the overall ANOVA tests for group differences, post hoc Scheffé comparisons reveal that the “white female” group, while showing lower mean scores, shares a grouping letter with at least one other category. This means that while minor variations exist, these differences are not statistically unique, i.e., the white female group does not differ significantly from others in mean BERT_F1 performance.\n",

    "In summary, the ANOVA suggests potential variation across groups, but the Scheffé test confirms that no protected class exhibits a distinctly different mean, reinforcing that evaluation performance remains broadly consistent across demographic categories."

    "Across all four ANOVA models, only the White female group showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in at least one evaluation metric, whereas all other protected classes displayed no significant differences (p > 0.05) compared to the reference group (White males).\n",
    "\n",
    "These results can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ANOVA tests evaluate mean differences independently across each score and are therefore more sensitive to small group-level variations, which may increase the likelihood of detecting isolated effects that do not persist in a multivariate context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. MANOVA, on the other hand, accounts for intercorrelations among evaluation metrics, allowing it to capture broader, multivariate trends that single ANOVAs may miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The discrepancy between the ANOVA and MANOVA findings suggests that the relationship among scores plays a greater role than any individual metric, and that multivariate dependencies may explain much of the observed variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the pattern indicates that White females consistently show distinct mean scores in at least one evaluation metric, suggesting a potential systematic scoring trend or group-specific bias. However, given the small effect sizes and the risk of Type I errors, further post-hoc tests and effect size analyses are required to determine whether these differences are practically meaningful or result from sample imbalance or confounding factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, since the interdependence between scores appears to be more informative than their individual behavior, we proceed with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to examine the underlying multivariate relationships and identify the linear combinations of scores that are most strongly correlated."

This trend is consistent with the earlier ANOVA results, which identified White females as the only group showing statistically significant score differences (p < 0.05). Most p-values for this group are below the 0.05 threshold (except BERT_Recall), suggesting both statistical and practical relevance.\n",

    "**Top 10 Most Negative Sentiment Score Differences:**\n",
    "The table lists the ten summaries with the largest negative sentiment score differences between White Male 1 and White Female versions, where negative values indicate more negative sentiment assigned to the White Male 1 version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across these samples, the differences range from approximately −0.26 to −0.57, showing cases where the White Female version was perceived notably more positively. Many of these summaries involve the recurring subject James Miller, appearing across multiple contexts (e.g., financial crimes, legal cases, public figures), suggesting a pattern of consistent polarity shifts tied to the same name entity rather than random variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest difference (−0.57) corresponds to the summary “James Miller, a Texan financier, defrauded about…,” where the male reference produced a more negative sentiment compared to the female version. This suggests a potential lexical or contextual sensitivity in the sentiment model’s interpretation of gendered references within similar textual patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while most sentiment differences across the dataset cluster near zero (as shown in the histogram), these outliers highlight specific narrative contexts where gender substitution alters sentiment polarity, warranting deeper linguistic analysis to identify whether such biases stem from model embedding associations, context phrasing, or gender-coded lexical cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top 10 Most Positive Sentiment Score Differences (Filtered for Male 1 > 0):**\n",
    "The table lists the ten summaries where White Male 1 received the most positive sentiment compared to White Female, with score differences ranging from +0.23 to +0.63. Positive values indicate that the model assigned a more favorable sentiment to the male-referenced summary than to the female-referenced counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the negative-difference results, several entries feature recurring entities such as James Miller, appearing across diverse roles (e.g., financier, preacher, carer, or fictional character). This repetition suggests that contextual phrasing and role semantics—rather than gender alone—may drive some of the sentiment variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest difference (+0.63) occurs in the sentence “Shirley Banfield and her daughter Lynette Banfield...,” where the male-referenced version was interpreted substantially more positively. Such instances may reflect model sensitivity to pronoun and co-reference structure, where substituting gendered identifiers subtly alters sentiment polarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these positive outliers highlight specific narrative contexts where gendered substitutions lead to sentiment divergence in favor of male references. While these examples contrast with earlier negative differences, the bidirectional variability reinforces that sentiment fluctuations are context-dependent rather than uniformly biased, warranting deeper linguistic and contextual analysis to disentangle content-driven effects from potential model bias."

    "This story is a strong choice for human review because the core event and factual details remain identical across both versions, minimizing potential confounding factors. The only substantive change is the name substitution (“James Miller” → “Mary Peterson”) and a few minor syntactic adjustments, ensuring that any variation in sentiment arises from the gendered reference rather than textual differences. Given that the topic involves cybercrime and financial fraud—contexts that often evoke strong emotional and moral judgments—the story provides an ideal scenario for detecting subtle shifts in sentiment or bias. It enables reviewers to evaluate whether the model’s sentiment polarity changes specifically due to the gender of the named defendant, rather than differences in narrative structure or meaning.\n",
